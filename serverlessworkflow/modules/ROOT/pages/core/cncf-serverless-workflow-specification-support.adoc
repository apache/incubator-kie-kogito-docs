This document provides an overview of how SonataFlow implements the link:{spec_website_url}[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Serverless Workflow] specification. {product_name} implements version link:{spec_doc_url}[{spec_version}] of the Serverless Workflow specification.

The following table shows the implementation status for each Serverless Workflow specification feature.

[NOTE]
====
{product_name} does not support link:{spec_doc_url}#Retry-Definition[Retries], link:{spec_doc_url}#sleep-state[Sleep
State], and has a limited support of link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-timeouts[Timeouts] features of Serverless Workflow
specification.

[[states]]
== States

The link:{spec_doc_url}#parallel-state[Parallel State] of the workflow states feature works in a single thread. This means that a Parallel State does not create one thread per branch, simulating an actual parallel behavior.

If an `exclusive` property is set to `false`, you should not use the link:{spec_doc_url}#Event-State[Event State] of the workflow states feature as the starting state. In case that it is specified that way, it will behave as if an `exclusive` property was set to `true`. 

[NOTE]
====
{product_name} does not support the link:{spec_doc_url}#sleep-state[Sleep State] feature. However, this feature will be supported in a future release.

For additional functions, the Serverless Workflow specification support the `custom` function type, such as `sysout` and `java`. For more information about these custom function types, see xref:core/custom-functions-support.adoc[Custom functions for your {product_name} service].

[[events]]
== Events

{product_name} supports events of the workflow model as defined in the link:{spec_doc_url}#Event-Definition[Serverless Workflow specification definition], except the following:

* `resultEventRef` property in link:{spec_doc_url}#eventref-definition[`EventRefDefinition`] is not implemented and, if specified, this property is ignored. The same functionality can be achieved by using xref:core/working-with-callbacks.adoc[Callback] state.
* link:{spec_doc_url}#correlation-definition[Correlation] has limited support, that evaluates correlation rules matching a single event consumed per time with a workflow instance. The correlation among `N` different events to be consumed and matched with a workflow instance is not supported in {product_name}. For more information about event correlation, see xref:eventing/event-correlation-with-workflows.adoc[Event correlation in {product_name}].

[[workflow_data]]
== Serverless Workflow data

{product_name} supports the implementation of the data manipulation feature using `jq` (default) or `jsonpath` expressions.

`jsonpath` expressions can have limitations in specific scenarios of complex data manipulation. For more information, see link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-data[Workflow Data] section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation.

{product_name} also supports data filtering. For more information about the data filtering, see link:{spec_doc_url}#state-data-filters[State data filters] section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation.

[[expressions]]
== Expressions

{product_name} supports `jq` or `jsonpath` to define the workflow expressions. `jq` is the default expression language, however, if you want to use `jsonpath`, set the `expressionLang` attribute in the workflow definition as shown in the following example:

.Example of changing the default expression language
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "myworkflow",
  "version": "1.0",
  "expressionLang": "jsonpath",
  "name": "Workflow example",
  "description": "An example of how to use jsonpath expressions"
}
----

[WARNING]
====
`jsonpath` expression is not recommended because of the limitations of the language for data manipulation. Instead, you can use `jq` in various use cases.
====


[[error_handling]]
== Error handling

{product_name} supports the error handling feature as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-error-handling[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

For more information about error handling, see xref:core/understanding-workflow-error-handling.adoc[Error handling in {product_name}].

[[retries]]
== Retries

{product_name} does not support Retries feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release.

Alternatively, you can use xref:core/understanding-workflow-error-handling.adoc[Error handling in {product_name}].

[[timeouts]]
== Timeouts

{product_name} has limited support for the timeouts feature, covering only workflow and event timeouts.

For start event state the `exclusive` property is not supported if set to `false`, therefore the timeout is not supported for the event state when starting a workflow.

For more information about timeouts, see xref:core/timeouts-support.adoc[Timeouts on events for {product_name}].

[[compensation]]
== Compensation

{product_name} supports workflow compensation as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#Workflow-Compensation[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

For more information about compensations, see xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/event-orchestration/orchestration-based-saga-pattern.adoc[Saga orchestration example in {product_name}].

[[constants]]
== Constants

{product_name} supports workflow constants as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-constants[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

[[secrets]]
== Secrets

{product_name} supports workflow secrets as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-secrets[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Secrets are associated with the link:{quarkus_config_guide_url}[Quarkus Configuration] module. This means that any form of configuration that Quarkus supports is also supported in {product_name}.
