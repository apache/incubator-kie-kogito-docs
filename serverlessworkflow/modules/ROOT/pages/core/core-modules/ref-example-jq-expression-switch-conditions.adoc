= Example of jq expressions in switch conditions

The conditions occurring in a switch state enable the workflow designer to select the path that workflow follows based on the data model content.

A condition in a switch state is an expression, which returns a boolean value when evaluated against the data model. If a condition associated with a state transition returns true, then the workflow must follow that transition.

For example, in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`] example application, a message is displayed depending on the selected language, that is English or Spanish.

If the value of the `language` property is English, the constant literal injected on the `message` property is _Hello from_, otherwise the constant value injected on the `message` property is _Saludos desde…_.

The switch state in the `serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus` example application contains the following conditions, which in turn contains two jq expressions returning a boolean.

"dataConditions": [
        {
          "condition": "${ .language == \"English\" }",
          "transition": "GreetInEnglish"
        },
        {
          "condition": "${ .language == \"Spanish\" }",
          "transition": "GreetInSpanish"
        }
      ]

NOTE: The Serverless Workflow specification requires all the expressions to be embedded within `${… }`. However, {product_name} figures out whether or not a string is an expression. Therefore, you can save characters and skip `${` in the beginning and `}` in the end. In case of portability, you must embed the expressions within `${… }`.
