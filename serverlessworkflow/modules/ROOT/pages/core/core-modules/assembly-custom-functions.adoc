= Custom functions for your {product_name} service

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) specification link:{spec_doc_url}#defining-custom-function-types[supports the `custom` function type], which enables the implementations to extend the function definition capability.

{product_name} supports the `java` and `sysout` custom types.

[WARNING]
====
The CNCF specification does not support `java` and `sysout` functions. Therefore, these functions might not be portable across other implementations.
