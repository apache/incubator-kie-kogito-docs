= Java custom function

{product_name} supports the `java` functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your workflow service.

== Function definition

The following example shows the declaration of a `java` function:

.Example of a `java` function declaration
[source,json]
----
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "myFunction", <1>
      "type": "custom", <2>
      "operation": "service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod" <3>
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> `myFunction` is the function name
<2> `custom` is the function type
<3> `service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod` is the custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition, `service` is the reserved operation keyword followed by the `java` keyword. `com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass` is the FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) of the interface or implementation class followed by the method name (`myMethod`).


== Function arguments

Your method interface signature must copy the arguments passed by the workflow.

For example, if you invoke a function using one argument as follows, then your method signature assumes that the `number` model variable is an integer:

.Example of a `java` function reference with one argument
[source,json]
----
{
 "functionRef": {
   "refName": "myFunction",
   "arguments": {
     "number": "${.number}"
   }
 }
}
----


.Example of a `java` function implementation
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {

  public void myMethod(int number) {
        if (number % 2 != 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Odd situation");
        }
    }
}
----

As a particular case, if you provide no argument in the workflow definition, the signature of the Java method might include a link:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson's] `JsonNode` parameter. This means that the Java method expects the entire workflow model as input.

When using the following example function reference with no arguments, and if the method signature contains a `JsonNode` parameter, the entire workflow model is passed when the method call is performed.

.Example of a `java` function reference with no arguments
[source,json]
----
{
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "myFunction"
   }
}
----


.Example of a `java` function implementation
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {

    public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) {
        // do whatever I want with the Workflow model
        ......
        // return the modified content:
        return workflowData;
    }
}
----

== Function return values

If your method returns a `JsonNode`, the content of that node is merged into the workflow model (you can use an action data filter to control what is merged).

The same occurs if your method returns any Java `Object` descendant that is not a primitive wrapper, the Java object is recursively converted to a JSON object and the result is merged into the workflow model (you can use an action data filter to control what is merged).

If your method returns a primitive type or their corresponding wrapper object (int, boolean, long, and so on), then the primitive value is added to the workflow model with the name `response` (you can change that name using an action data filter).

If your method returns Java collections, it is converted to a JSON array and added to the workflow model with the name `response` (you can change that name using an action data filter).

== Function accessing Kogito context

If you need access to process contextual information (for example, Kogito process instance ID) inside your Java service, you can add a `KogitoProcessContext` parameter as the last one in the method signature.

Therefore, if you need to do so, you can update the signature of methods from previous sections.

.Example of a function accessing Kogito context
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {
public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData, KogitoProcessContext context ) {
        // do whatever I want with the JsonNode and the Kogito process context
        ......
        // return the modified content:
        return workflowData;
    }
}
----

.Example of a function accessing Kogito context
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {


    public void myMethod(int number, KogitoProcessContext context) {
        if (number % 2 != 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Odd situation");
        }
    }
}
----


[WARNING]
====
Avoid using `java` functions to call the external services, instead, you can use the xref:service-orchestration/orchestration-of-openapi-based-services.adoc[services orchestration features].
