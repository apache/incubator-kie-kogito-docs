The Serverless Workflow specification defines several link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-timeouts[timeouts configurations] that you can use to configure maximum times for the workflow execution in different scenarios.
For example, you can configure how long a workflow can wait for an event to arrive when it is in a given state, etc. Currently, {product_name} supports only the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-timeout-definition[workflow execution timeout] and link:{spec_doc_url}#event-timeout-definition[event timeouts].

Regardless of its application scope (workflow or state), the timeouts must be configured as an amount of time (a duration), which is considered to start when the referred scope becomes active. Timeouts use the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[`ISO 8601` data and time standard] to specify a duration of time and follow the format `PnDTnHnMn.nS` with days considered to be exactly 24 hours.
For instance, `PT15M` configures 15 minutes, and `P2DT3H4M` defines 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes.

[#workflow-timeout]
== Workflow timeout 
To configure the maximum amount of time a workflow can be running before being canceled, you can use the workflow timeout.
This is configured in the header section of the workflow, by using the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflowexectimeout-definition[WorkflowExecTimeout definition]. Only the `duration` property is currently implemented.
Once canceled, the workflow is considered to be finished, and will not be accessible through a GET request anymore. So it behaves as if the interrupt was `true` by default.

For example, to cancel the workflow after an hour of execution, you must use the following configuration.

  } ...
}

== Event timeout

When you define a state in a workflow, you can use the `timeouts` property to configure the maximum time to complete this state.
When that time is overdue, the state is considered timed-out, and the engine continues the execution from this state. The execution flow depends on the state type, for instance,
a transition to a next state might be executed.
All the properties that you can use to configure state timeouts are described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#states-timeout-definition[Serverless Workflow specification].

Event-based states can use the sub-property `eventTimeout` to configure the maximum time to wait for an event to arrive.
This is the only property that is supported in current implementation.

[#callback-state-timeout]
=== Callback state timeout
The Callback state can be used when you need to execute an action, in general to call an external service, and wait for an asynchronous response in form of an event, the callback.

Once the response event is consumed, the workflow continues the execution, in general moving to the next state defined in the `transition` property. See more on xref:eventing/working-with-callbacks.adoc[Callback state in {product_name}].

Since the Callback state halts the execution until the event is consumed, you can configure an `eventTimeout` for it, and in case the event does not arrive in the configured time duration, the workflow continues the execution moving to the next state defined in the transition, see the <<callback-state, example>>.

[#switch-state-timeout]
=== Switch state timeout

The Switch state can be used when you need to take an action depending on certain conditions, these conditions can be based on the workflow data, link:{spec_doc_url}#Switch-state-Data-Conditions[dataConditions], or on events, link:{spec_doc_url}#Switch-State-Event-Conditions[eventConditions].

When you use the link:{spec_doc_url}#Switch-State-Event-Conditions[eventConditions], the workflow execution waits to make a decision until any of the configured events arrives and matches a condition.
In this situation, you can configure an event timeout, that controls the maximum time to wait for an event to match the conditions.

If this time expires, the workflow moves to the state defined in the `defaultCondition` property of the Switch state, as you can see in the <<switch-state, example>>.

See more details about this state on the link:{spec_doc_url}#switch-state[Serverless Workflow specification - Switch State].

[#event-state-timeout]
=== Event state timeout

The Event state is used to wait for one or more events to be received by the workflow, execute a set of actions, and then continue the execution.
If the Event state is a starting state, a new workflow instance is created.

[NOTE]
====
The Event state is not supported as a starting state if the `exclusive` flag is set to `false`, therefore timeout is not supported in this case.
====

The `timeouts` property is used for this state to configure the maximum time the workflow should wait for the configured events to arrive.

If this time is exceeded and the events are not received, the workflow moves to the state defined in the `transition` property or ends the workflow instance (in case of an end state), without performing any actions.

You can see this in the <<event-state, example>>.

For more information about Event state timeout, see link:{spec_doc_url}#event-timeout-definition[Serverless Workflow specification - Event State].

== Deploying a timed-based workflow

To deploy a workflow that uses timeouts, or any other timer-based action, it is necessary to have a {job_service_xref}[job service] running in your environment, which is an independent service responsible to control the workflows timers, see the {job_service_xref}#integration-with-the-workflows[job service] for more information.
The provisioning of this service depends on the work mode that you are using.

=== {operator_name} Dev Profile

When you work with the {operator_name} Dev Profile, the operator will automatically provide an execution environment that contains an embedded {job_service_xref}[job service] instance, as well as an instance of the {data_index_xref}[data index service].
And thus, there is no need for additional configurations.

In the <<timeouts-showcase, timeouts showcase>> you can see the details of how to work with timeouts and the {operator_name} Dev Profile.

=== Quarkus Workflow Project

When you work with a standalone Quarkus Workflow Project, you must:

1. Configure the project to include the required addon for the workflows to connect with that service.

2. Ensure that a jobs service instance is available in your environment.

In the {job_service_xref}[job service] guide you can see all the available add-ons and configuration alternatives for this case.
