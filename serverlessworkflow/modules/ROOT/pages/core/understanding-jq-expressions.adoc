Each workflow instance is associated with a data model. A data model consists of a JSON object regardless of whether the workflow file contains YAML or JSON. The initial content of the JSON object depends on how the workflow is started. If the workflow is created using the link:{cloud_events_url}[Cloud Event], then the workflow content is taken from the `data` property. However, if the workflow is started through an HTTP POST request, then the workflow content is taken from the request body.

The workflow expressions in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-expressions[Serverless Workflow specification] are used to interact with the data model. The supported expression languages include link:{jsonpath_url}[JsonPath] and link:{jq_url}[jq]. jq expression language is the default language. However, you can change the expression language to JsonPath using the `expressionLang` property. 

This document describes the usage of jq expressions in functions, switch state conditions, action function arguments, data filtering, and event publishing. 

JQ expression might be tricky to master, for non trivial cases, it is recommended to use helper tools like link:{jq_play}[JQ Play] to validate the expression before including it in the workflow file. 

[[ref-example-jq-expression-function]]
== Example  of jq expression in functions

Expressions can be used in functions of type `expression` to manipulate the workflow model. As with any other function, the result of the expression evaluation will be merged into the model.

For example, in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`] example application, a max function adds to the model two properties: `max`, containing the maximum value of `x` coordinate in the `numbers` array (which is a workflow input parameter) and `min`, containing the minimum value of `y` coordinate

.Example conditions in `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`
[source,json]
----
  {
      "name": "max",
      "type": "expression",
      "operation": "{max: .numbers | max_by(.x), min: .numbers | min_by(.y)}"
    }
----

[[ref-example-jq-expression-switch-conditions]]
== Example of jq expressions in switch conditions

The conditions occurring in a switch state enable the workflow designer to select the path that workflow follows based on the data model content.

A condition in a switch state is an expression, which returns a boolean value when evaluated against the data model. If a condition associated with a state transition returns true, then the workflow must follow that transition.

For example, in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`] example application, a message is displayed depending on the selected language, that is English or Spanish. 

If the value of the `language` property is English, the constant literal injected on the `message` property is _Hello from_, otherwise the constant value injected on the `message` property is _Saludos desde…_.

The switch state in the `serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus` example application contains the following conditions, which in turn contains two jq expressions returning a boolean.

.Example conditions in `serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`
[source,json]
----
"dataConditions": [
        {
          "condition": "${ .language == \"English\" }",
          "transition": "GreetInEnglish"
        },
        {
          "condition": "${ .language == \"Spanish\" }",
          "transition": "GreetInSpanish"
        }
      ]
----

[NOTE]
====
The Serverless Workflow specification requires all the expressions to be embedded within `${… }`. However, {product_name} figures out whether or not a string is an expression. Therefore, you can save characters and skip `${` in the beginning and `}` in the end. In case of portability, you must embed the expressions within `${… }`.

[[ref-example-jq-expression-function-arguments]]
== Example of jq expressions in function arguments

In the Serverless Workflow specification, you can define link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-functions[workflow functions], which can be invoked several times by the workflow states. Each workflow function call might contain different arguments, which are specified using the function arguments.

For example, you can see the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion/conversion-workflow/src/main/resources/fahrenheit-to-celsius.sw.json[temperature conversion] function definition in `serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion` example application. The temperature conversion function performs OpenAPI invocations to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. For more information about OpenAPI, see xref:service-orchestration/orchestration-of-openapi-based-services.adoc[Orchestrating the OpenAPI services].

Following is the `subtraction` function in `serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion` example application:

.Example `subtraction` function in `serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion`
[source,json]
----
"functions": [
{
  "name": "subtraction",
  "operation": "specs/subtraction.yaml#doOperation"
}]
----

The arguments in `subtraction` function are expressed as a JSON object, and the property values of the JSON object are either a string containing an expression or a link:{json_data_types_url}[JSON data type], such as string, number, or boolean. 

.Example arguments in `subtraction` function
[source,json]
----
"functionRef": 
{
  "refName": "subtraction",
  "arguments": 
  {
    "leftElement": ".fahrenheit",
    "rightElement": ".subtractValue"
  }
}
----

In the previous example, the left number is equal to the `fahrenheit` property (an input number that invokes the workflow), and the right number is equal to the `subtractValue` property (a constant number that is injected to the workflow model by `SetConstants` state). Once the expression evaluation is resolved for all properties that contain an expression, the resulting object is passed in the OpenAPI request. Based on the OpenAPI definition, the properties in the JSON object are used as body, path, query, or header of the upcoming REST invocation. 

Following is an example of function arguments defined as string that contains an expression, returning a JSON object:

.Example function arguments defined as string
[source,json]
----
"functionRef": {
  "refName": "subtraction",
  "arguments": "{leftElement: .fahrenheit, rightElement : .subtractValue}"
 }

----

In the previous example, the result of the expression evaluation is the same JSON object than in the first case, which is passed as arguments of the OpenAPI request.

[[ref-example-jq-expression-data-filtering]]
== Example of jq expressions in data filtering

The Serverless Workflow specification defines the following filtering mechanisms to select which information must be part of the workflow data model:

* link:{spec_doc_url}#action-data-filters[Action data filters]: Select the part of the action result that is merged into the data model, which overrides the properties that share the name with the selected action result.  
* link:{spec_doc_url}#event-data-filters[Event data filters]: Similar to the action data filters, but apply to the events instead of actions.
* link:{spec_doc_url}#state-data-filters[State data filters]: Define the workflow model to the JSON object, which is returned by the expression and discards an existing property.

State and Action data filter example::
+
--
You can see link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`] example application, in which actions and state data filters are used.

image::core/expression_diagram.png[]

Following is an expression function in `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus` example application:

.Example expression function in `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`
[source,json]
----
"functions": [
    {
      "name": "max",
      "type": "expression",
      "operation": "{max: .numbers | max_by(.x), min: .numbers | min_by(.y)}"
    }
]
----

In the previous example, an array of complex numbers (`x` is real coordinate and `y` is imaginary coordinate) is accepted and an expression function is defined to calculate the maximum value of `x` and minimum value of `y` for the `numbers` array. 

Also, the `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus` example application contains an action data filter defined inside `squareState` action and a state data filter defined inside `finish` state. The action data filter selects the maximum value of `x` to be merged to the workflow model, and the state data filter defines the maximum value as the entire workflow model that is returned as the workflow response. 

The previous example expression also contains a `max` function of type expression and an `operation` property containing a string of jq expression. This jq expression returns a JSON object, in which the `max` property is the maximum value of the `x` coordinate and the `min` property is the minimum value of the `y` coordinate.

Following is an action data filter in `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus` example application:

.Example action data filter in `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`
[source,json]
----
"actions": [
        {
          "name": "maxAction",
          "functionRef": {
            "refName": "max"
          },
          "actionDataFilter": {
             "results" : ".max.x",
             "toStateData" : ".number"
          }
        }
 ]
----

In case the previous example of action data filter is not added in the `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`, then the entire JSON object returned by the function is merged into the workflow model. The previous action data filter contains the following properties:

* `results`, selecting the attribute from the data returned by the action.
* `toStateData`, indicating the name of the target property inside the workflow model. If the target property does not exist, then a target property is added.

Therefore, after executing the action, the workflow model consists of a `number` property, containing the maximum value of `x` and the original `numbers` array. After that, the workflow transitions to the `finish` state.

.Example state data filter in `serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`
[source,json]
----
"name": "finish",
"type": "operation",
"stateDataFilter": {
   "input": "{result: .number}"
}
----

The original `numbers` array should not be returned as a result of the workflow execution, therefore the final stage consists of a state data filter defining the content of the output model. The output model should contain a `result` property and the value of `result` property should be the maximum number that is stored by the previous state in the `number` property. 

In the previous example, the workflow model is changed by the `input` property of the filter, which means that the output model is updated before the state is executed. As a final result, the output model consists of a `result` property, containing the maximum value of `x`.

Event data filter example::
+
--

You can find an example of event data filtering in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus`] example application. 

.Example event filter
[source,json]
----
  "eventRef": "waitEvent",
  "eventDataFilter": {
     "data": ".result",
     "toStateData": ".move"
   }
----

The previous example of the event filter copies the content of CloudEvent data `result` field into the workflow model `move` field.

[[ref-example-jq-expression-event-publishing]]
== Example of jq expressions in event publishing. 

When publishing a Cloud Event, you can select the data that is being published using a jq expression that generates a JSON object. Note that in yaml double quotes are required to allow using `{}` characters. 

.Example data expression returning an object
[source,yaml]
----
transition:
      nextState: WaitForSaveTransformationCompletionEvent
      produceEvents:
        - eventRef: saveTransformationEvent
          data: "{gitRepo:.repositoryURL|sub(\"http(s)?://\";\"ssh://\"), branch: .targetBranch, token: .token, workspaceId: .workspaceId, projectId: .projectId, transformId: .transformId, workflowCallerId: $WORKFLOW.instanceId}" 
----

In the previous example, a CloudEvent was published when the state transitioned. Its `data` field looks like 

.Example of generated event
[source,json]
----
data={"gitRepo":"ssh://bitbucket.org/m2k-test","branch":"aaaaaaasssss","token":null,"workspaceId":"b93980cb-3943-4223-9441-8694c098eeb9","projectId":"9b305fe3-d441-48ce-b01b-d314e86e14ec","transformId":"723dce89-c25c-4c7b-9ef3-842de92e6fe6","workflowCallerId":"7ddb5193-bedc-4942-a857-596b31f377ed"}
----

== Workflow secrets, constants and context

As per specification, you can use link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-constants[Workflow Constants] and link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-secrets[Workflow Secrets] whenever an expression is accepted. 
In {product_name} you can use `$SECRET` to access any configuration property, not just sensitive ones.
So, assuming you have added to your `application.properties` a line with the `myname=john` property, the following function will append the string `my name is john` to the `message` variable
[source,json]
----
{
      "name": "secretMessage",
      "type": "expression",
      "operation": ".message |= \"my name is \"+$SECRET.my_name"
}
----

`$SECRET` always returns a value of type string. If you want to use it in a comparison with a value that is not a string, you must perform the conversion explicitly. In the next example, the `retries` property is a number, so we need to convert the property value accordingly by calling the `tonumber` built-in jq function. 

[source,json]
----
{
  "condition": ".retries > ($SECRET._max_retries|tonumber)"
}
----

Besides constants and secrets, you might access contextual information of the running workflow by using the $WORKFLOW reserved word.
{product_name} supports the following contextual keys:
 * `id`: The id of the running workflow definition
 * `name`: The name of the running workflow definition
 * `instanceId`: The id of the running workflow instance
 * `headers`: Optional map containing the headers, if any, of the invocation that started the running workflow instance 
 * `prevActionResult`: In a `foreach` state using multiple actions per loop cycle, give access to the result of the previous action. See link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-foreach-quarkus/src/main/resources/foreach.sw.json#L11[example]
 * `identity`: Quarkus security identity
 
 Therefore, the following function, for a serverless workflow definition whose id  is `expressionTest`, will append the string `worklow id is expressionTest` to the `message` variable

----
{
      "name": "contextMessage",
      "type": "expression",
      "operation": ".message |= \"workflow id is \"+$WORKFLOW.id"
}
----
 
=== Customizing workflow context

In addition to the predefined keys mentioned previously, you can add your own keys to workflow context using Java Service Loader mechanism, by providing an implementation of class link:{kogito_runtimes_url}/kogito-serverless-workflow/kogito-serverless-workflow-utils/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/serverless/workflow/utils/KogitoProcessContextResolverExtension.java[KogitoProcessContextResolverExtension] 

This feature was used to add quarkus security identity support, you can check source code as reference link:{kogito_runtimes_url}/quarkus/extensions/kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow-extension/kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/serverless/workflow/QuarkusKogitoProcessContextResolver.java[here].
