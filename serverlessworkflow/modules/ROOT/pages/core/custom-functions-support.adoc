= Custom functions for your {context} service

:compat-mode!:
// Metadata:
:description: Custom Functions Support
:keywords: kogito, workflow, serverless, cncf, specification, functions, java

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) specification link:{spec_doc_url}#defining-custom-function-types[supports the `custom` function type], which enables the implementations to extend the function definition capability.

{product_name} supports the `java` and `sysout` custom types.

[WARNING]
====
The CNCF specification does not support `java` and `sysout` functions. Therefore, these functions might not be portable across other implementations.
====

[[con-func-sysout]]
== Sysout custom function

You can use the `sysout` function for debugging or for quick demonstrations as shown in the following example:

.Example of `sysout` function definition
[source,json]
----
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "printMessage",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "sysout"
    }
  ]
}
----

In the `state` definition, you can call the same `sysout` function as shown in the following example:

.Example of a `sysout` function reference within a `state`
[source,json]
----
{
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "myState",
      "type": "operation",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "printAction",
          "functionRef": {
            "refName": "printMessage",
            "arguments": {
              "message": "."
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

[WARNING]
====
You must avoid using the `sysout` function in a production environment since it can spam the unnecessary data in the application log.
====

[[con-func-java]]
== Java custom function

{product_name} supports the `java` functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your workflow service.

=== Function Definition

The following example shows the declaration of a `java` function:

.Example of a `java` function declaration
[source,json]
----
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "myFunction", <1>
      "type": "custom", <2>
      "operation": "service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod" <3>
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> `myFunction` is the function name
<2> `custom` is the function type
<3> `service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod` is the custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition, `service` is the reserved operation keyword followed by the `java` keyword. `com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass` is the FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) of the interface or implementation class followed by the method name (`myMethod`).


=== Function Arguments

Your method interface signature must copy the arguments passed by the workflow.

For example, if you invoke a function using one argument as follows, then your method signature assumes that the `number` model variable is an integer:

.Example of a `java` function reference with one argument
[source,json]
----
{
 "functionRef": {
   "refName": "myFunction",
   "arguments": {
     "number": "${.number}"
   }
 }
}
----


.Example of a `java` function implementation
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {

  public void myMethod(int number) {
        if (number % 2 != 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Odd situation");
        }
    }
}
----

As a particular case, if you provide no argument in the workflow definition, the signature of the Java method might include a link:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson's] `JsonNode` parameter. This means that the Java method expects the entire workflow model as input.

When using the following example function reference with no arguments, and if the method signature contains a `JsonNode` parameter, the entire workflow model is passed when the method call is performed.

.Example of a `java` function reference with no arguments
[source,json]
----
{
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "myFunction"
   }
}
----


.Example of a `java` function implementation
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {

    public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) {
        // do whatever I want with the Workflow model
        ......
        // return the modified content:
        return workflowData;
    }
}
----

=== Function return values

If your method returns a `JsonNode`, the content of that node is merged into the workflow model (you can use an action data filter to control what is merged).

The same occurs if your method returns any Java `Object` descendant that is not a primitive wrapper, the Java object is recursively converted to a JSON object and the result is merged into the workflow model (you can use an action data filter to control what is merged).

If your method returns a primitive type or their corresponding wrapper object (int, boolean, long, and so on), then the primitive value is added to the workflow model with the name `response` (you can change that name using an action data filter).

If your method returns Java collections, it is converted to a JSON array and added to the workflow model with the name `response` (you can change that name using an action data filter).

=== Function accessing Kogito context

If you need access to process contextual information (for example, Kogito process instance ID) inside your Java service, you can add a `KogitoProcessContext` parameter as the last one in the method signature.

Therefore, if you need to do so, you can update the signature of methods from previous sections.

.Example of a function accessing Kogito context
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {
public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData, KogitoProcessContext context ) {
        // do whatever I want with the JsonNode and the Kogito process context
        ......
        // return the modified content:
        return workflowData;
    }
}
----

.Example of a function accessing Kogito context
[source,java]
----
public class MyInterfaceOrClass {


    public void myMethod(int number, KogitoProcessContext context) {
        if (number % 2 != 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Odd situation");
        }
    }
}
----


[WARNING]
====
Avoid using `java` functions to call the external services, instead, you can use the xref:service-orchestration/orchestration-of-openapi-based-services.adoc[services orchestration features].
====

== Camel custom function

Kogito supports the link:{camel_url}[Camel Routes] functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your workflow service.

[NOTE]
====
This section briefly exemplifies how to define and use Camel Routes within your workflow application. For more information, see the xref:integrations/camel-routes-integration.adoc[Integrating with Camel Routes].
====

=== Function definition

The following example shows the declaration of a Camel function:

[source,json]
----
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "myCamelEndpoint", <1>
      "type": "custom",  <2>
      "operation": "camel:direct:myendpoint" <3>
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> `myCamelEndpoint` is the function name
<2> `custom` is the function type
<3> `camel:direct:myendpoint` is the custom operation definition. In this definition, `camel` is the reserved keyword followed by the `direct` endpoint. link:{camel_extensions_url}/direct.html[Camel Direct] is the only supported consumer by {context}. Finally, `myendpoint` is the endpoint URI name found in the route within your project's context.

=== Function arguments

The Camel function arguments must follow a specific structure when passing data from the workflow state to the route. The `body` and `headers` are the only attributes supported in the function arguments. Both are optional if you need to call the Camel routes without arguments. The only constraint is that you can not call a Camel route with only `headers`.

The following examples display valid argument structures for Camel function arguments:

.Example calling a Camel route using `body` and `headers`
[source,json]
----
{
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "myCamelEndpoint",
    "arguments": {
      "body": "${ .my.body.data }", <1>
      "headers": { <2>
        "key1": "${ .my.value }",
        "key2": "${ .my.other.value }"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

<1> `jq` expression filtering the state data for the `body` argument.
<2> JSON key/value pair for the `headers` argument. A `jq` expression returning the same JSON object is also valid.

.Example calling a Camel route using `body`
[source,json]
----
{
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "myCamelEndpoint",
    "arguments": {
      "body": "${ .my.body.data }"
    }
  }
}
----

.Example calling a Camel route without arguments
[source,json]
----
{
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "myCamelEndpoint"
  }
}
----

.Example calling a Camel route with only one argument
[source,json]
----
{
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "myCamelEndpoint",
    "arguments": "${ .my.body.data }"
  }
}
----

In this last example, the `jq` expression result is used as the `body` argument in a way to simplify the definition.

=== Function return values

The Camel route is responsible to produce the return value in a way that the workflow can understand. The following are considered valid objects:

include::../../pages/_common-content/camel-valid-responses.adoc[]

[#knative-custom-function]
== Knative custom function

{product_name} provides an implementation of a custom function through the `knative-serving` add-on to invoke Knative services. It allows you to have a static URI, defining a Knative service, which is used to perform HTTP requests. The Knative service defined in the URI is queried in the current Knative cluster and translated to a valid URL.

[NOTE]
====
This section briefly exemplifies how to define and use Knative custom functions within your workflow application. For more information, see xref:integrations/custom-functions-knative.adoc[Invoking Knative services from Serverless Workflow].
====

=== Function definition

Given the following deployed Knative service:

[source,bash]
----
$ kn service list
NAME                              URL                                                                      LATEST                                  AGE     CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
custom-function-knative-service   http://custom-function-knative-service.default.10.109.169.193.sslip.io   custom-function-knative-service-00001   3h16m   3 OK / 3     True
----

You can declare a {context} custom function using the Knative service name, like the following:

[source,json]
----
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "greet", <1>
      "type": "custom", <2>
      "operation": "knative:custom-function-knative-service" <3>
    }
  ]
----

<1> `greet` is the function name
<2> `custom` is the function type
<3> `knative:custom-function-knative-service` is the custom operation definition. In this definition, `knative` is the reserved keyword followed by the `custom-function-knative-service` Knative service.

The above function will send a `POST` request to the http://custom-function-knative-service.default.10.109.169.193.sslip.io URL.

[NOTE]
====
`GET` requests are not yet supported.
====

[[about-namespaces]]
==== About namespaces

Note that in the above example, you declared only the name of the service you wanted to call, but not a namespace. In this case, {product_name} will look for a Knative service in the same namespace the workflow service is running.

In case you need to call a Knative service in a different namespace, you can declare the function as:

[source,json]
----
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "knative:my_different_namespace/custom-function-knative-service"
    }
  ]
----

In the above example, {product_name} will look for the `custom-function-knative-service` in the `my_different_namespace` namespace.

=== Function metadata

==== HTTP resource path

You can specify the HTTP resource path by adding the `path` property to the function's metadata.

For instance, given the `/path/to/my/resource` HTTP resource path, you can define your function as:

[source,json]
----
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "knative:custom-function-knative-service",
      "metadata": {
        "path": "/path/to/my/resource"
      }
    }
  ]
----

In case you don't specify any path, the root path will be used. For instance, the following function:

[source,json]
----
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "knative:custom-function-knative-service"
    }
  ]
----

Is exactly the same as:

[source,json]
----
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "knative:custom-function-knative-service",
      "metadata": {
        "path": "/"
      }
    }
  ]
----

=== Function arguments

In case you need to send a payload in the request, you can add it to `arguments` in `functionRef`.

==== Sending a regular JSON object

You must send the following JSON object as the payload:

[source,json]
----
{
  "product_id": ".product_id",
  "customer_name": ".customer_name"
}
----

You must declare a `functionRef` like the following.

[source,json]
----
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "invokeFunction",
      "type": "operation",
      "actions": [
        {
          "functionRef": {
            "refName": "greet",
            "arguments": { <1>
              "product_id": ".product_id",
              "customer_name": ".customer_name"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "end": true
    }
  ]
----
<1> The request payload is set in `arguments`.

[[sending-cloudevents]]
==== Sending a CloudEvent

By default, {product_name} sends the payload of a Knative function as a regular JSON object and `Content-Type` as `application/json`. However, you can tell {product_name} to send the payload as a CloudEvent. In that case, {product_name} will check if the CloudEvent has all mandatory attributes set and use `application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8` in `Content-Type`.

To tell {product_name} you want to send the payload as a CloudEvent, you must define your function as follows:

[source,json]
----
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "knative:custom-function-knative-service",
      "metadata": {
        "path": "/",
        "asCloudEvent": true <1>
      }
    }
  ]
----

<1> Tells {product_name} to send the payload as a CloudEvent. Default is `false`

[WARNING]
====
If you do not set the `asCloudEvent` attribute to `true`,  you can not send a CloudEvent. If you do so, {product_name} will throw an error.
====

You must send the following CloudEvent as the payload:

[source,json]
----
{
  "specversion" : "1.0",
  "type" : "com.github.pull_request.opened",
  "source" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull",
  "subject" : "123",
  "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
  "comexampleextension1" : "value",
  "comexampleothervalue" : 5,
  "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
  "data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>"
}
----

You must declare a `functionRef` like the following: (Do not forget to set `asCloudEvent` as `true` in function metadata)

[source,json]
----
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "invokeFunction",
      "type": "operation",
      "actions": [
        {
          "functionRef": {
            "refName": "greet",
            "arguments": { <1>
                "specversion" : "1.0",
                "type" : "com.github.pull_request.opened",
                "source" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull",
                "subject" : "123",
                "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
                "comexampleextension1" : "value",
                "comexampleothervalue" : 5,
                "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
                "data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "end": true
    }
  ]
----
<1> The CloudEvent is set in `arguments`.

[NOTE]
====
{product_name} generates a CloudEvent ID based on the `source` and the workflow instance ID. In case an ID is set, {product_name} will ignore it and use a generated one.
====

=== Configurations

==== Request timeout

By default, the Knative service must respond within 10 seconds. You can use the `kogito.addon.knative-serving.request-timeout` property to configure this value.

For instance, if you want to reduce the request timeout to 5 seconds, you must add the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
kogito.addon.knative-serving.request-timeout=5000 <1>
----
<1> Time in milliseconds

== Custom function types

You can add your custom types by using the Kogito add-on mechanism. As predefined custom types like xref:core/custom-functions-support.adoc#con-func-sysout[`sysout`] or xref:core/custom-functions-support.adoc#con-func-java[`java`], the custom type identifier is the prefix of the operation field of the function definition.

Kogito add-ons relies on the link:{quarkus_guides_base_url}/writing-extensions[Quarkus extensions] mechanism. And the add-on consists of at least two Maven projects:

- The deployment module, which is responsible for generating the code required for the extension to work.
- The runtime module, which includes the non-generated classes that are required for the extension to work.

In the case of a Serverless Workflow custom type, following are the roles of the modules:

- *The deployment project*
+
The deployment project is expected to configure the work item handler used during runtime to perform the logic associated with the custom type.
It must contain a Java class that inherits from `WorkItemTypeHandler`. Its responsibilities are to indicate the custom type identifier (the operation prefix, as indicated earlier) and to set up the `WorkItemNodeFactory` instance passed as a parameter of the `fillWorkItemHandler` method. That instance is included in the Kogito process definition for that Workflow. As a part of this setup, you must indicate the name of the  `WorkItemNodeFactory`. You might also provide any relevant metadata for that handler if needed.

- *The runtime project*
+
The runtime project consists of a `WorkflowWorkItemHandler` implementation, which name must match with the one provided to `WorkItemNodeFactory` during the deployment phase, and a `WorkItemHandlerConfig` bean that registers that handler with that name.
+
When a Serverless Workflow function is called, Kogito identifies the proper `WorkflowWorkItemHandler` instance to be used for that function type (using the handler name associated with that type by the deployment project) and then invokes the `internalExecute` method. The `Map` parameter contains the function arguments defined in the workflow, and the `WorkItem` parameter contains the metadata information added to the handler by the deployment project. Hence, the `executeWorkItem` implementation has an access to all the information needed to perform the computational logic intended for that custom type.

=== Custom function type example

Assuming you want to interact, from a workflow file, with a legacy RPC server as the one defined in link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc-server[this project]. This legacy server supports four simple arithmetic operations: add, minus, multiply and divide, which can be invoked using a custom RPC protocol.

Since this is an uncommon protocol, the workflow cannot handle them by using any of the predefined Serverless Workflow function types. The available options are to use a Java service, which invokes a Java class that knows how to interact with the server, or define a custom type that knows how to interact with the service.

Using the recent approach, you can write a link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-type-example/src/main/resources/customType.sw.json[workflow file] defining this function.

.RPC Custom function definition example

[source,json]
----
 "functions": [
    {
      "name": "division",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "rpc:division"
    }
  ],
----

The `operation` starts with `rpc`, which is the custom type identifier, and continues with `division`, which denotes the operation that will be executed in the legacy server.

A Kogito addon that defines the `rpc` custom type must be developed for this function definition to be identified. It is consist of a link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc-deployment[deployment project] and a link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc[runtime project].

The deployment project is responsible for extending the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc-deployment/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/examples/sw/services/RPCCustomTypeHandler.java[`WorkItemTypeHandler`] and setup the `WorkItemNodeFactory` as follows:

.Example of the RPC function Java implementation

[source,java]
----

import static org.kie.kogito.examples.sw.custom.RPCCustomWorkItemHandler.NAME;
import static org.kie.kogito.examples.sw.custom.RPCCustomWorkItemHandler.OPERATION;

public class RPCCustomTypeHandler extends WorkItemTypeHandler{


    @Override
    public String type() {
        return "rpc";
    }

    @Override
    protected <T extends RuleFlowNodeContainerFactory<T, ?>> WorkItemNodeFactory<T> fillWorkItemHandler(Workflow workflow,
                                                                                                        ParserContext context,
                                                                                                        WorkItemNodeFactory<T> node,
                                                                                                        FunctionDefinition functionDef) {
        return node.workName(NAME).metaData(OPERATION, trimCustomOperation(functionDef));
    }
}

----

This example setups the name of the `KogitoWorkItemHandler`, adds a metadata key with the name of the remote operation (extracted from the Serverless Workflow function definition operation property), and declares that the custom type is named as `rpc`.

The Runtime project contains the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/examples/sw/custom/RPCCustomWorkItemHandler.java[KogitoWorkItemHandler] and the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/examples/sw/custom/RPCCustomWorkItemHandlerConfig.java[WorkItemHandlerConfig] implementations.

As expected, `RPCCustomWorkItemHandler` implements the `internalExecute` method as follows:

.Example of implementation of the `internalExecute` method

[source, java]
----
 @Override
protected Object internalExecute(KogitoWorkItem workItem, Map<String, Object> parameters)  {
    try {
        Iterator<?> iter = parameters.values().iterator();
        Map<String, Object> metadata = workItem.getNodeInstance().getNode().getMetaData();
        String operationId = (String) metadata.get(OPERATION);
        if (operationId == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException ("Operation is a mandatory parameter");
        }
        return CalculatorClient.invokeOperation((String)metadata.getOrDefault(HOST,"localhost"), (int) metadata.getOrDefault(PORT, 8082),
                OperationId.valueOf(operationId.toUpperCase()), (Integer)iter.next(), (Integer)iter.next());
    } catch (IOException io ) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(io);
    }
}
----

The implementation invokes the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-custom-type/serverless-workflow-custom-rpc-server/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/examples/sw/custom/CalculatorClient.java#L45-L67[`CalculatorClient.invokeOperation`], a java static method that knows how to interact with the legacy service. You can obtain the operation parameter from the `WorkItem` metadata. The dividend and the divisor parameters are obtained from the Map parameter, which contains the function arguments defined in the workflow file.

.Example of the custom function call from the workflow definition

[source, json]
----
{
  "actions":[
    {
      "functionRef":{
        "refName":"division",
        "arguments":{
          "dividend":".dividend",
          "divisor":".divisor"
