:description: Defining input schema for Serverless Workflow
:keywords: kogito, workflow, serverless, dataInputSchema

== Input schema

The `dataInputSchema` in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-definition-structure[Serverless Workflow specification] is a parameter used in the workflow definition. The `dataInputSchema` parameter validates the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema. It is important to provide `dataInputSchema`, as it is used to verify if the provided workflow data input is correct before any workflow states are executed.

You can define a `dataInputSchema` as follows:

.`dataInputSchema` definition
[source,json]
----
"dataInputSchema": {
   "schema": "URL_to_json_schema",
   "failOnValidationErrors": false
}
----

In the previous definition, the `schema` property is a URI, which holds the path to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input. The URI can be a classpath URI, a file, or an HTTP URL. If a classpath URI is specified, then the JSON schema file must be placed in the resources section of the project or any other directory included in the classpath.

`failOnValidationErrors` is an optional flag that indicates the behavior adopted when the input data does not match the specified JSON schema. If not specified or set to true, an exception will be thrown and flow execution will fail. If set to false, the flow will be executed and a log of level WARN with the validation errors will be printed.

== Output schema

Serverless Workflow specification does not support JSON output schema until version 0.9. Therefore {product_name} is implementing it as a link:{spec_doc_url}#extensions[Serverless Workflow specification extension]. Output schema is applied after workflow execution to verify that the output model has the expected format. It is also useful for Swagger generation purposes. 

Similar to Input schema, you must specify the URL to the JSON schema, using `outputSchema` as follows:

.`outputSchema` definition
[source,json]
----
"extensions" : [ {
      "extensionid": "workflow-output-schema",
      "outputSchema": { 
         "schema" : "URL_to_json_schema",
          "failOnValidationErrors": false
     }
  ]
----

The same rules described for `dataInputSchema` apply for `schema` and `failOnValidationErrors`. The difference is that the latter flag is applied after workflow execution.

== Example with `dataInputSchema` and `outputSchema`

You can see the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus[serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus] example application of a workflow definition with `dataInputSchema` and `outputSchema`. 

== Swagger documentation

When a workflow definition contains a `dataInputSchema` and/or `outputSchema` attribute, the workflow application generates an OpenAPI file, such as `http://localhost:8080/q/openapi`. The generated OpenAPI file references the schema file, which helps in defining the input and checking the output data for the workflows. For more information about the OpenAPI file, see link:{open_api_spec_url}[OpenAPI specification].

If you want to generate an OpenAPI file for a workflow, then you must add the link:{quarkus_swagger_url}#expose-openapi-specifications[Quarkus dependency] in the project.
