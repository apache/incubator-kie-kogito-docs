== What's inside?

The Serverless Logic Sandbox provides 3 different editors for your projects:

* Serverless Workflow editor, for `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml` files;
* Serverless Decision editor, for `.yard.json` or `.yard.yaml` files;
* Dashbuilder editor, for dashboards.

== Getting started

Not much needs to be done to start creating your projects in the sandbox. You can start by creating a new project from scratch or using one of the samples provided.

On the home page, choose the type of project you want to create, then click the button corresponding to the file type you wish (JSON or YAML).

.Create

A new workspace will be created, containing a single file of the chosen type. The file is created with the name "Untitled", but clicking its name allows you to rename it to your liking.

Editing the file will update the preview on the right-hand side of the editor and saving is done automatically all the time.

The files are persisted in the browser, but syncing can be done with the xref:tooling/serverless-logic-sandbox/serverless-logic-sandbox-github-integration.adoc[Github integration].
