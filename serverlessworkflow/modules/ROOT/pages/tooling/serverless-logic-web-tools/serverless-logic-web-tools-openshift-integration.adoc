== Setting up KIE Sandbox Extended Services

The KIE Sandbox Extended Services tool is required to proxy requests to an OpenShift instance, thus making it possible to deploy and monitor projects.

.Prerequisites
* None.

.Procedure
. In the {serverless_logic_web_tools_name}, click on the **Cog wheel** (⚙️) on the top right corner and go to the **KIE Sandbox Extended Services** tab;
. If you're not connected you should see the following message: "**You are not connected to KIE Sandbox Extended Services. Click to setup**" as well as a **Host** and **Port** fields filled with `http://localhost` and `21345` respectively;
. Click the link in the message and a new window will appear, with your current operating system already selected and a link to download the latest version of the KIE Sandbox Extended Services;
. Download the file and execute it; (You may need to grant permissions to run the file, depending on your OS and settings!)
. The contents of the tab should be updated, showing that everything is set and you are connected to the KIE Sandbox Extended Services.

== Connecting to your OpenShift instance

.Prerequisites
* Have the KIE Sandbox Extended Services tool installed and running;
* Have an OpenShift instance up (you can create a free developer sandbox here link:{openshift_developer_sandbox_url}[OpenShift Developer Sandbox]).

.Procedure
. Start by logging into your OpenShift instance console interface;
. You'll need your OpenShift project name (also known as namespace), the API server and an access token:
  * For the OpenShift project name look at the **Topology** tab, and in the top left corner you should see your project name;

. Having all that information, go back to the {serverless_logic_web_tools_name}, click on the **Cog wheel** (⚙️) on the top right corner and go to the **OpenShift** tab;
. Fill the **Namespace (project)** field with the OpenShift instance project name;
. Fill the **Host** field with the value copied from the **--server** flag;
. Fill the **Token** field with the API Token;
. Now you can click on **Connect** and if everything is correct the tab should update to show **You're connected to OpenShift**.

Now you should be ready to start deploying your projects with the {serverless_logic_web_tools_name}, check how to do it xref:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-deploy-projects.adoc[here].

Note: If your OpenShift instance uses self-signed certificates you may need to enable `InsecureSkipVerify` on KIE Sandbox Extended Services.
