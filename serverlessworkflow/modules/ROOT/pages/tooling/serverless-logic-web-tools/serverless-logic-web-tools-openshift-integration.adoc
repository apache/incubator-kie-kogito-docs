== Setting Extended Services

The Extended Services tool is required to proxy requests to an OpenShift instance. Therefore, setting the Extended Services enables you to deploy and monitor your {product_name} projects.

.Procedure
. In the {serverless_logic_web_tools_name} web application, click the *Cogwheel* (⚙️) on the top-right corner and go to the *Extended Services* tab.
. In case you are not connected to Extended Services, you see *You are not connected to Extended Services. Click to setup* message.
. Click on the link in the message.
+
A window appears containing your current operating system as selected and a link to download the latest version of Extended Services.

. Download the Extended Services and execute it.
+
--
You might need to grant permissions to run the file depending on your operating system and settings.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using macOS, you might encounter the `"Extended Services" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to Bin` error message while running the "Extended Services" application. This is due to the overeager https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491[approach towards security] by macOS and you can fix it by moving the "Extended Services" application out of quarantine. You can execute the `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/KIE\ Sandbox\ Extended\ Services.app` command to achieve this.
====

After executing the Extended Services the content in the *Extended Services* is updated and displays that you are connected to the Extended Services.

== Connecting to OpenShift instance using {serverless_logic_web_tools_name}

After setting the Extended Services, you can connect to your OpenShift instance to deploy your {product_name} projects with {serverless_logic_web_tools_name}.

.Prerequisites
* Extended Services tool is installed and running.
* OpenShift instance is active.
+
You can create a free developer sandbox. For more information, see link:{openshift_developer_sandbox_url}[OpenShift Developer Sandbox].

.Procedure
. Log in to your OpenShift instance console interface.
. In the OpenShift instance console interface, you need your OpenShift project name (also known as namespace), API server, and an access token.
+
--
* For the OpenShift project name, go to the *Topology* tab and in the top-left corner you see your project name.
+
