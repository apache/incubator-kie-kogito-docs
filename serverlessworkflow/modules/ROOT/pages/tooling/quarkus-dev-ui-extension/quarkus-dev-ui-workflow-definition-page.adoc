The table on the Workflow Definitions page displays the following details:

* *Workflow Name*: Displays the name of a workflow definition.
* *Endpoint*: Displays the URL to a workflow definition.
* *Actions*: Provides a button to start a new Serverless Workflow.

The filters on the Workflow Definitions page enables you to add filters to the table. To search for a specific workflow definition, enter the name of the workflow in the *Filter by workflow name* field and click *Apply Filter* button. The matching workflow definitions appear as a chip below the search field. 

To clear the applied filters, you can click the *Reset to default* button. Also, to fetch newly added workflow definitions, click on the refresh icon next to the *Apply Filter* button.

To trigger a cloud event, you can use the *Type* and *Data* input fields to set the type of a cloud event and event payload in JSON format respectively, and click the *Send* button to start a workflow. The *Reset* button on the page resets the values entered in the given fields.

You can also use the *Business key* text box to define a custom business key value to the workflow instance. If the *Business Key* field is blank, then an auto-generated business key is defined to the workflow instance.

When a workflow instance starts successfully, a success alert appears on the top of the screen, which contains a *Go to workflow list* option. The *Go to workflow list* option enables you to navigate to the xref:tooling/quarkus-dev-ui-extension/quarkus-dev-ui-workflow-instances-page.adoc[Workflow Instances page].
