This guide shows how to configure OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange when invoking OpenAPI-secured services from workflows.

For general OpenAPI orchestration and authentication, see:

* {configuring-openapi-services-endpoints}[Configuring the OpenAPI services endpoints]
* {authentication-support-for-openapi-services}[Authentication for OpenAPI services]


== When to use Token Exchange

Use Token Exchange if:

* You must avoid forwarding the original end-user token to third-party services.
* You have long running workflow which may cause token invalidity (expiration).

If you only need to forward the original token, see token propagation in {authentication-support-for-openapi-services}#ref-authorization-token-propagation[Authorization token propagation].

== How Token Exchange works

At a high level, Token Exchange lets the workflow swap the incoming bearer token for a new token tailored to the downstream service.
The Quarkus OIDC Client Filter performs the exchange transparently before the OpenAPI client call. See link:https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect-client[Quarkus OIDC Client Filter] for more details.

.Flow overview
[%autowidth,cols="1,5"]
|===
|Step |Description

|1 |Client calls the workflow REST endpoint and sends `Authorization: Bearer <user-access-token>`.
|2 |The OpenAPI client (generated for a secured operation) is invoked by the workflow.
|3 |The credential provider checks the cache for a valid exchanged token for this process instance and auth name; if found and not near expiry, it is reused.
|4 |If no valid token is found, the OIDC Client Filter detects the `oauth2` security scheme and requests a Token Exchange at the IdP, using the incoming token as the subject token and the configured audience.
|5 |The Identity Provider returns the exchanged access token (for example, audience `downstream-api`), which is cached with its expiry.
|6 |The OpenAPI client calls the downstream service with `Authorization: Bearer <exchanged-token>`.
|7 |Downstream service responds; workflow proceeds and returns the result to the client.
|8 |Proactive refresh: a background monitor refreshes cached tokens nearing expiration based on `sonataflow.security.auth.<auth_name>.token-exchange.proactive-refresh-seconds` and `sonataflow.security.auth.token-exchange.monitor-rate-seconds`.

== Requirements

* Quarkus OIDC Client Filter extension in the workflow service:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-oidc-client-filter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* The OpenAPI operation is secured with an `oauth2` security scheme (the OIDC client name is derived from the scheme name).

* Quarkus add-on to enable token exchange and caching in your runtime:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-addons-quarkus-token-exchange</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Those extensions should be passed to the internal builder when building the workflow image, see xref:cloud/operator/build-and-deploy-workflows.adoc#passing-build-arguments-to-internal-workflow-builder[Passing arguments to the internal builder]

== Example OpenAPI security

[source, yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.3
paths:
  /secured:
    get:
      operationId: callService
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
      security:
        - service-oauth: [ ]
components:
  securitySchemes:
    service-oauth:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        clientCredentials:
          authorizationUrl: https://idp.example.com/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/auth
          tokenUrl: https://idp.example.com/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/token
          scopes: {}
----

The security scheme name `service-oauth` determines the OIDC client name (sanitized to `service_oauth`) used by the client filter.


== Caching and persistence of exchanged tokens

The Token Exchange feature introduces a caching mechanism with proactive refresh and optional database persistence.

=== What is loaded by default

Without extra configuration, the add-on provides:

* In-memory cache using Caffeine with per-token expiration.
* Proactive refresh handled by a background monitor.

Enable the feature per auth scheme name and optionally tune refresh/monitor:

[source,properties]
----
# Enable Token Exchange for a specific auth name (matches the OpenAPI oauth2 scheme name after sanitization)
sonataflow.security.auth.service_oauth.token-exchange.enabled=true

# Seconds before token expiration to proactively refresh the cached token (default ~300)
sonataflow.security.auth.service_oauth.token-exchange.proactive-refresh-seconds=300

# Global monitor rate (seconds) for the cache refresh/cleanup
sonataflow.security.auth.token-exchange.monitor-rate-seconds=60

# To ensure the incoming `Authorization` header is available when a workflow waits and later resumes (or after service restarts), enable header persistence:
kogito.persistence.headers.enabled=true
----


=== Persist exchanged tokens (override default)

By default, the cache metadata is kept in-memory. To persist exchanged tokens, include the JDBC token persistence extension which provides a CDI `TokenCacheRepository` backed by a JDBC `DataSource`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow-jdbc-token-persistence</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The extension should be passed to the internal builder when building the workflow image, see xref:cloud/operator/build-and-deploy-workflows.adoc#passing-build-arguments-to-internal-workflow-builder[Passing arguments to the internal builder]


You can also provide your own implementation by producing a CDI bean of type `org.kie.kogito.addons.quarkus.token.exchange.persistence.TokenCacheRepository`. When present, it overrides the default in-memory repository.

=== How caching works

* The OpenAPI credential provider computes a cache key per request (process instance, auth name, subject token, audience) and checks the cache.
* On miss, it exchanges the token via the configured OIDC client and stores the result alongside expiration/refresh metadata.
* An expiry policy evicts tokens at their individual expiration time; an eviction handler coordinates proactive refresh.

== Configuration

Configure the OIDC client and enable Token Exchange per OpenAPI security scheme. The client filter will obtain the incoming bearer token and exchange it for a new token before invoking the OpenAPI client generated for the secured operation.

[source,properties]
----
# 1) Generated client package and base URL (example)
#    Replace 'service_api_yaml' with your OpenAPI file id (sanitized filename)
quarkus.rest-client.service_api_yaml.url=http://localhost:8480

# 2) Enable Token Exchange for the OpenAPI oauth2 scheme defined as 'service-oauth'
#    (sanitized auth name is 'service_oauth')
# see Configuration reference for more possible properties
sonataflow.security.auth.service_oauth.token-exchange.enabled=true

# 3) OIDC client for the service-oauth scheme (normalized to service_oauth)
# Should be updated with your own values
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.discovery-enabled=false
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.auth-server-url=https://idp.example.com/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/auth
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.token-path=https://idp.example.com/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/token
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.client-id=kogito-app
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.grant.type=exchange
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.credentials.client-secret.method=basic
quarkus.oidc-client.service_oauth.credentials.client-secret.value=secret
----

[NOTE]
====
* The incoming request to the workflow must include `Authorization: Bearer <user-access-token>` so the client filter can perform the exchange.
* If you also need token propagation (forward the incoming token), configure it per service and auth name. For the example above:
** `quarkus.openapi-generator.service_api_yaml.auth.service_oauth.token-propagation=true`
* If both exchange and propagation are enables for the same scheme, token propagation takes precedence a no exchange will be performed. 
This behaviour is brought by the openapi-generator library with custom `CredentialsProvider` implementations.

[NOTE]
====
"Conditional" means the property is required only in certain setups:

* For `quarkus.oidc-client.<auth_name>.auth-server-url` and `quarkus.oidc-client.<auth_name>.token-path`:
** If `discovery-enabled=true`, the client discovers endpoints from the issuer, so `token-path` is not required.
** If `discovery-enabled=false`, you must provide `token-path` and an authorization server URL. Some environments allow `token-path` as an absolute URL, otherwise set both.
* For `quarkus.oidc-client.<auth_name>.credentials.client-secret.value`: required only when the client uses a secret-based authentication method (for example, `client-secret-basic` or `client-secret-post`). Not required for public clients or when using non-secret methods such as mTLS or `private_key_jwt`.

== Workflow invocation example

Send the user’s token to the workflow; the OpenAPI call secured by `service-oauth` will use the exchanged token automatically:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/my_workflow \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"value"}'
----

== Interaction with OpenAPI configuration

* Security scheme names in the OpenAPI file are global. All operations secured by `service-oauth` will use the same OIDC client and Token Exchange configuration.
* You can still use the standard OpenAPI Generator properties for codegen and base URLs as usual.
