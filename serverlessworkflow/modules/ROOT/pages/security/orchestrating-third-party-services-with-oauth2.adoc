This guide shows how to implement and configure a Serverless Workflow that orchestrate the interaction with an Oauth2 secured REST service.

For information about orchestrating and configuring the OpenAPI based services, you must see the following documents:

* {orchestration-of-opnapi-based-services}[Orchestration of OpenAPI based services]
* {configuring-openapi-services-endpoints}[Configuring OpenAPI services endpoints in different environments]
* {authentication-support-for-openapi-services}[Authentication support for OpenAPI services]

== Introduction

Imagine that you have a set of applications that must resolve currency exchange calculations as part of their regular operations. For that, you need an accurate source of information to get the different exchange rates.

Fortunately, your company has a commercial agreement with Acme Financial Services, and those rates can be queried using their Oauth2 secured services. Additionally, as confidential client, you were granted with proper credentials to access these services as part of the agreement.

However, you don't want to expose Acme's services to the applications.

== Solution

Implement a Serverless Workflow that resolves:

* The orchestration with Acme's services and the currency exchange calculation.
* The authentication requirements to access that service.
* Potential vendor lock-in problems if you want to change the provider in the future.
* Domain specific validations, optimizations, etc.

The next sections shows how to create the end-to-end solution by following the {kogito_sw_examples_serverless_workflow_oauth2_orchestration_url}[serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus] example.

[NOTE]
====
To get the source code of the example you must clone the {kogito_examples_repository_url}[GitHub repository] and go to the `serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` directory.
====

=== Services

The following services compose the solution:

* `currency-exchange-workflow`: Is the Serverless Workflow that implement the currency exchange calculation.

* `acme-financial-service`: Is the REST service that provides the exchange rates.

* `acme-oauth2-server`: Is the Keycloak server that secures Acme's REST services.

=== Architecture

The following diagram shows the architecture of the solution:

.Architecture diagram

image::security/orchestrating-third-party-services-with-oauth2/architecture-diagram.png[Architecture diagram]

. The application creates a Serverless Workflow instance to calculate the currency exchange.
. The workflow executes the OpenAPI operation to get the exchange rates information.
. Authorizations are produced to validate the access.
. The workflow receives the exchange rates information and execute the calculations.
. The workflow execution finalize by sending the result to the application.

[NOTE]
====
The interactions with the Oauth2 server are managed automatically by the Serverless Workflow.
And you must only configure a {quarkus_guide_security_openid_connect_client_url}[Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC)] as described <<Configuration, here>>.
====

== Currency Exchange Workflow

=== Diagram

The following figure shows the `currency-exchange-workflow` diagram:

.currency-exchange-workflow diagram
image::security/orchestrating-third-party-services-with-oauth2/currency-exchange-workflow-diagram.png[]

. Input data is validated.
. Check the validation results:
.. If validation is successful, transition to (3).
.. If validation failed, no transition, finalize the workflow with the error execution status.
. Call `acme-financial-service` to get the exchange rate:
.. If the call is successful, transition to (4).
.. If the call fails, transition to (6).
. Calculate the currency exchange and transition to (5).
. Set the successful execution status and finalize the workflow execution.
. Set the error execution status and finalize the workflow execution.

=== Definition

The following Serverless Workflow specification defines the `currency-exchange-workflow`:

----
<1> <<ValidateInputs, ValidateInputs>> state: executes the `validateInputs` function to validate the input data.
<2> `CheckValidation` state: determines the next state to go by evaluating the validation results.
<3> <<GetExchangeRate, GetExchangeRate>> state: executes the `getExchangeRate`  to get the exchange rate from the remote server.

<5> `EndWithError` state: finalize the process with the `ERROR`.
<6> `EndSuccessful` state: finalize the process with the successful `OK` status.

=== ValidateInputs

To execute custom Java processing as part of the Serverless Workflow, you can use a {spec_doc_functions_for_custom_function_types_url}[CNCF Serverless Workflow custom function] such as `validateInputs`.

--
.validateInputs function definition
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "validateInputs", <1>
  "type": "custom", <2>
  "operation": "service:org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper::validateInputs" <3>
}
----

<1> `validateInputs` function declaration.
<2> The `custom` type implements the ability use your own Java class to implement a function.
<3> Specifies that the function is implemented by the method `validateIntpus` in the Java class `org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper`.
--

[NOTE]
====
The parameters and results for a custom function are processed like any other function type.
====

To implement the function you must create a Java class such as `ExchangeWorkflowHelper` in your project:

--
.ExchangeWorkflowHelper.java file
[source, java]
----
package org.kie.kogito.examples;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ExchangeWorkflowHelper {

    public ValidationResult validateInputs(String currencyFrom,
                                           String currencyTo,
                                           double amount,
                                           String exchangeDate) {
        // Implement your custom Java processing here and return
        // a Java POJO to the Serverless Workflow.
        if (!good) {
            return new ValidationResult("ERROR", "Not good!");
        }
        return new ValidationResult();
    }

    public static class ValidationResult {
        private String executionStatus;
        private String executionStatusMessage;
        // getters, setters, etc.
    }
}
----
--

=== GetExchangeRate

To access the `acme-financial-service` you can use a {spec_doc_functions_for_restful_service_invocation_url}[CNCF Serverless Workflow function], such as `getExchangeRate`:

--
.getExchangeRate function definition
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "getExchangeRate", <1>
  "type": "rest",
  "operation": "specs/acme-financial-service.yml#exchangeRate" <2>
}
----

<1> `getExchangeRate` function declaration.
<2> Specifies that the function is implemented by the `exchangeRate` operation in the `acme-financial-service.yml`.
--

[NOTE]
====
For the configuration above the file `acme-financial-service.yml` must be located in the `src/main/resources/specs` directory of the project.
====

You can find more information in {orchestration-of-opnapi-based-services}[Orchestration of OpenAPI based services].

To filter the information that must be returned to the workflow you can use a {spec_doc_action_data_filters_url}[CNCF Serverless Workflow actionDataFilter] such as:

--
.actionDataFilter to pass the `getExchangeRate` results:
[source, json]
----
  "actionDataFilter": {
    "results": "${ {exchangeRate: .rate} }" <1>
  }
----
<1> Merge the `"rate"` property value coming in the `acme-financial-service` invocation result, into a workflowdata property `"exchangeRate"`.
--

=== CalculateExchange

To calculate the currency exchange you can use a {spec_doc_functions_for_expression_evaluation_url}[CNCF Serverless Workflow function], such as `calculateExchange`:

--
.calculateExchange function definition
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "calculateExchange", <1>
  "type": "expression", <2>
  "operation": "${ { calculateExchangeResult: .amount * .exchangeRate } }" <3>
}
----

<1> `calculateExchange` function declaration.
<2> The `expression` type implements the ability use an expression to implement a function.
<3> Specifies that the function returns a JSON object with a property `"calculateExchangeResult"` that contains the calculation.
--

To filter the information that must be returned to the workflow you can use a {spec_doc_action_data_filters_url}[CNCF Serverless Workflow actionDataFilter] such as:

--
.actionDataFilter to pass the `calculateExchange` results:
[source, json]
----
  "actionDataFilter": {
    "results": "${ {result: .calculateExchangeResult} }" <1>
  }
----
<1> Merge the `"calculateExchangeResult"` property value coming from the expression result into a workflowdata property `"result"`.

[NOTE]
====
You can find the full implementation of this service in the `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus/acme-financial-service` directory.

== Configuration

Most relevant configurations for the Serverless Workflow:

.Example application.properties file
[source, properties]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.acme_financial_service_yml.base-package=com.acme <1>

quarkus.rest-client.acme_financial_service_yml.url=http://localhost:8483 <2>

quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.discovery-enabled=false <3>
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8281/auth/realms/kogito/protocol/openid-connect/auth <4>
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.token-path=http://localhost:8281/auth/realms/kogito/protocol/openid-connect/token <5>
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.client-id=kogito-app <6>
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.grant.type=client
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.credentials.client-secret.method=basic <7>
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.credentials.client-secret.value=secret <8>
----

<1> Is the package name for the automatically generated classes that implements the access to the all operations defined in the file `acme-financial-service.yml`.
<2> Is the root URL to access all the operations defined in the file `acme-financial-service.yml`. For the `exchangeRate` operation, an absolute URL such as \http://localhost:8483/financial-service/exchange-rate is automatically generated.

<3> Disable the Oauth2 server endpoints discovery since the endpoints provided in the <<acme-financial-service-yml, acme-financial-service.yml>> file will be used instead.
<4> Is the authentication URL of the Oauth2 server.
<5> Is the relative path or absolute URL of the Oauth2 token endpoint which issues access and refresh tokens.
<6> Is the client-id to identify the Serverless Workflow against the authorization service, such as `kogito-app`. This identifier must be provided by Acme.
<7> Is the method to use at the time to send the client-secret for the authentications when the client grant type is used.
<8> Is the client secret to authenticate the Serverless Workflow against the authorization service when the client grant type is used. This secret must be provided by Acme.

To configure the `acme_financial_service_oauth` {quarkus_guide_security_openid_connect_client_url}[Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC)] you must follow the rules described in {authentication-support-for-openapi-services-oauth-example}[Example of OAuth2 authentication].
And the particular attributes depends on the Oauth2 server and authorization flow to use, you can get this information from the OpenAPI specification of the target service <<acme-financial-service-yml, acme-financial-service.yml>>.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the alternatives defined in the {quarkus_guide_config_reference_url}[Quarkus configuration reference guide] to configure these properties.
A common usage is to define {quarkus_guide_config_reference_environment_variables_url}[environment variables] to set the authentication secrets, and you can also use the {quarkus_guide_credentials_provider_url}[Quarkus Credentials Provider] framework.
