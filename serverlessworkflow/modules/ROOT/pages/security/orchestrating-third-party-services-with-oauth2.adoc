This document describes the example of how you can implement and configure a workflow that orchestrates the interaction with an OAuth 2.0 secured REST service.

For more information about orchestrating and configuring OpenAPI services, see {orchestration-of-openapi-based-services}[Orchestrating the OpenAPI services], {configuring-openapi-services-endpoints}[Configuring the OpenAPI services endpoints], and {authentication-support-for-openapi-services}[Authentication for OpenAPI services in {product_name}].

[[ref-example-oauth2-orchestration]]
== Example of OAuth 2.0 orchestration in a workflow

To understand the example of OAuth 2.0 orchestration in a workflow, you can use the link:{kogito_sw_examples_serverless_workflow_oauth2_orchestration_url}[`serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus`] example application. This example application implements a workflow related to currency exchange calculations, which orchestrates an OAuth 2.0 secured REST service provided by Acme Financial Services.

Suppose you have a set of applications that must resolve the currency exchange calculations as their regular operations, and to resolve the currency exchange calculations, you need to get the accurate exchange rates. For this purpose, you can use the Acme Financial Services.

When you use the Acme Financial Services, you can query the exchange rates using their OAuth 2.0 secured services, which you can access using the granted credentials. However, you do not want to expose the services provided by Acme to the applications. In this case, you can implement a workflow that resolves the following aspects:

* Orchestration with services provided by Acme and currency exchange calculations.
* Authentication requirements to access the services provided by Acme.
* Potential vendor lock-in problems, in case you want to change the provider in future.
* Domain-specific validations and optimizations.

The further sections describes how an end-to-end solution is created in the `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` example application. To see the source code of `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` example application, you can clone the link:{kogito_examples_repository_url}[kogito-examples] repository in GitHub and select the `serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` directory.

The `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` example application contains the following services to compose the solution:

* `currency-exchange-workflow`: Workflow that implements the currency exchange calculations.
* `acme-financial-service`: REST service that provides the exchange rates.
* `acme-oauth2-server`: Keycloak server that secures the REST services from Acme Financial Services.

The following figure describes the architecture of the solution in `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` example application:

.Example architecture diagram of the solution
image::security/orchestrating-third-party-services-with-oauth2/architecture-diagram.png[Architecture diagram]

. The application creates a workflow instance to calculate the currency exchange.
. The workflow executes an OpenAPI operation to get the exchange rates information.
. Authorizations are produced to validate the access.
. The workflow receives the exchange rates information and executes the calculations.
. The execution of workflow is finalized by sending the result to the application.

[NOTE]
====
The workflow automatically manages the interactions with the OAuth 2.0 server. Also, you must configure a link:{quarkus_guide_security_openid_connect_client_url}[Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC)]. For more information, see <<con-example-sw-configuration, Configuration in `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` example application>>.

`currency-exchange-workflow`::
+
--
The `currency-exchange-workflow` in `serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus` example application is a workflow that implements the currency exchange calculations.

The following figure describes the workflow in `currency-exchange-workflow`:

.Example `currency-exchange-workflow`
image::security/orchestrating-third-party-services-with-oauth2/currency-exchange-workflow-diagram.png[]

. First, validate the input data.
. Check the validation results:
.. If validation is successful, then transition to (3).
.. If validation is unsuccessful, then no transition and finalize the workflow with the error execution status.
. Send REST request to `acme-financial-service` to retrieve the exchange rates:
.. If the request is successful, then transition to (4).
.. If the request is unsuccessful, then transition to (6).
. Calculate the currency exchange and transition to (5).
. Set the successful execution status and finalize the `currency-exchange-workflow` execution.
. Set the error execution status and finalize the `currency-exchange-workflow` execution.

The following `currency-exchange-workflow.sw.json` file shows the specification of the `currency-exchange-workflow`:

<1> `ValidateInputs` state executes the `validateInputs` function to validate the input data.
<2> `CheckValidation` state determines the next state to go by evaluating the validation results.
<3> `GetExchangeRate` state executes the `getExchangeRate` function to retrieve the exchange rate from the remote server.
<4> `CalculateExchange` state executes the `calculateExchange` function to calculate the currency exchange.
<5> `EndWithError` state finalizes the workflow with an `ERROR`.
<6> `EndSuccessful` state finalizes the workflow with successful `OK` status.

The `validateInputs` function is used to execute the custom Java processing as part of the workflow. For more information about custom functions, see link:{spec_doc_functions_for_custom_function_types_url}[Serverless Workflow specification].

The following is an example of `validateInputs` function definition:

.Example `validateInputs` function definition
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "validateInputs", <1>
  "type": "custom", <2>
  "operation": "service:org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper::validateInputs" <3>
}
----

<1> `validateInputs` function declaration.
<2> `custom` type that enables you to use your own Java class to implement a function.
<3> Specifies that the function is implemented by the method `validateIntpus` in the `org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper` Java class.

To implement a custom function, you must create a Java class such as `ExchangeWorkflowHelper` in your project:

.Example `ExchangeWorkflowHelper.java` file
[source, java]
----
package org.kie.kogito.examples;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ExchangeWorkflowHelper {

    public ValidationResult validateInputs(String currencyFrom,
                                           String currencyTo,
                                           double amount,
                                           String exchangeDate) {
        // Implement your custom Java processing here and return
        // a Java POJO to the Serverless Workflow.
        if (!good) {
            return new ValidationResult("ERROR", "Not good!");
        }
        return new ValidationResult();
    }

    public static class ValidationResult {
        private String executionStatus;
        private String executionStatusMessage;
        // getters, setters, etc.
    }
}
----

To access the `acme-financial-service` REST service in `currency-exchange-workflow`, a workflow function such as `getExchangeRate` is used. For more information about using functions for REST services, see link:{spec_doc_functions_for_restful_service_invocation_url}[Serverless Workflow specification].

Following is the function definition of `getExchangeRate`:

.Example `getExchangeRate` function definition
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "getExchangeRate", <1>
  "type": "rest",
  "operation": "specs/acme-financial-service.yml#exchangeRate" <2>
}
----

<1> `getExchangeRate` function declaration.
<2> Specifies that the function is implemented by the `exchangeRate` operation in the `acme-financial-service.yml` file.

For the previous configuration, the `acme-financial-service.yml` file must be located in the `src/main/resources/specs` directory of the project.

In order to filter the information, which must be returned to the `currency-exchange-workflow`, an `actionDataFilter` is used:

.Example `actionDataFilter` to pass the `getExchangeRate` results
[source, json]
----
  "actionDataFilter": {
    "results": "${ {exchangeRate: .rate} }" <1>
  }
----
<1> Merge the value of the `rate` property to the `exchangeRate` workflow data property. The value of the `rate` property is retrieved from the `acme-financial-service` invocation result.

For more information about action data filters, see link:{spec_doc_action_data_filters_url}[Action data filters] in Serverless Workflow specification.

To calculate the currency exchange rates in `currency-exchange-workflow`, a function named `calculateExchange` is used:

.Example `calculateExchange` function definition
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "calculateExchange", <1>
  "type": "expression", <2>
  "operation": "${ { calculateExchangeResult: .amount * .exchangeRate } }" <3>
}
----

<1> `calculateExchange` function declaration.
<2> `expression` type that enables you to use an expression to implement a function.
<3> Specifies that the function returns a JSON object with a `calculateExchangeResult` property, containing the calculation.

For more information about using functions for expression evaluation, see link:{spec_doc_functions_for_expression_evaluation_url}[Serverless Workflow specification].

Similar to `getExchangeRate` to filter the information, which must be returned to the `currency-exchange-workflow`, an `actionDataFilter` is used:

.Example `actionDataFilter` to pass the `calculateExchange` results:
[source, json]
----
  "actionDataFilter": {
    "results": "${ {result: .calculateExchangeResult} }" <1>
  }
----

<1> Merge the value of the `calculateExchangeResult` property to the `result` workflow data property. The value of the `calculateExchangeResult` property is retrieved from the expression result.

quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.credentials.client-secret.method=basic <7>
quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.credentials.client-secret.value=secret <8>
----

<1> Package name for automatically generated classes that implement the access to all operations defined in the `acme-financial-service.yml` file.
<2> Root URL to access all operations defined in the `acme-financial-service.yml` file. For the `exchangeRate` operation, a URL such as `\http://localhost:8483/financial-service/exchange-rate` is automatically generated.
<3> Disables the OAuth 2.0 server endpoints discovery as the endpoints provided in the `acme-financial-service-yml` file are used instead.
<4> Authentication URL of the OAuth 2.0 server.
<5> Relative path or URL of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint, which allocates access and refreshes tokens.
<6> Client ID to identify the workflow against the authorization service, such as `kogito-app`. This identifier must be provided by Acme.
<7> Method that is used at the time of sending the `client-secret` for the authentications when the client grant type is used.
<8> `client-secret` to authenticate the workflow against the authorization service when the client grant type is used. This secret must be provided by Acme.

To configure the link:{quarkus_guide_security_openid_connect_client_url}[Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC)] for `acme_financial_service_oauth` service, you must follow the rules described in {authentication-support-for-openapi-services-oauth-example}[Example of OAuth 2.0 authentication].

Also, the particular attributes depend on the OAuth 2.0 server and authorization flow to use. You can get the information about the OAuth 2.0 server and authorization flow from the `acme-financial-service.yml` file.

[TIP]
====
Also, you can use the alternatives defined in the link:{quarkus_guide_config_reference_url}[Quarkus configuration reference guide] to configure the properties in `application.properties` file. You can define link:{quarkus_guide_config_reference_environment_variables_url}[environment variables] to set the authentication secrets, and you can use the link:{quarkus_guide_credentials_provider_url}[Quarkus Credentials Provider] framework.

[NOTE]
====
In the previous examples, the currencies supported by the `currency-exchange-workflow` include `EUR`, `USD`, `JPY`, `GBP`, `CAD`, `BRL`, and `AUD`. However, the `acme-financial-service` REST service can resolve any type of currency exchange. This is an example of a workflow implementing the intermediate data filtering, transforming, and validations.
====

The following is an example of the occurrence of unexpected errors when accessing `acme-financial-service`:

Before you launch the command, you must go to the terminal window where you started the `acme-financial-service` and stop the service using `CTRL+C`.
