This document describes how to mock OpenAPI services using WireMock. The testing procedure described in this document is based on the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-service-calls-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-service-calls-quarkus`] example application.

link:{wiremock_url}[WireMock] is an open source Mocking API for unit, integration, and performance tests. You can use WireMock to isolate your tests from third party APIs and prototype APIs that do not exist.

.Prerequisites
The examples used in this document assumes that you have the following prerequisites:

* Required tooling is installed. For more information, see {getting-familiar-with-our-tooling}[Getting familiar with {product_name} tooling].
* A workflow project is created and orchestrates OpenAPI services.
+
For more information about orchestrating OpenAPI services, see {orchestration-of-openapi-based-services}[Orchestrating the OpenAPI services].

== Adding a mocked OpenAPI service to your tests

The procedure in this section describes how you can add WireMock to your workflow application.

.Prerequisites

include::../../pages/_common-content/getting-started-requirement.adoc[]

.Procedure
. Add the following WireMock dependency to the `pom.xml` file of your project:
+
--
.Add WireMock dependency to `pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock-jre8</artifactId>
    <version>{wiremock.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `{wiremock.version}` variable with the version of WireMock that you want to use.
====
--

. Select one of the following methods to start your WireMock server:
+
--
* You can start the WireMock server as a `QuarkusTestResource`. If you select this method, then the WireMock server is started once before you run any test, and the server is stopped when the test finishes. This option is suitable for most use cases.

* You can start the WireMock server independently for each test. This option is useful when you want each test to behave differently.

For more information about starting the WireMock server, see <<proc-start-wiremock-server-quarkustestresource, Starting WireMock server as a `QuarkusTestResource`>> and <<proc-start-wiremock-server-specific-test, Starting WireMock server for a specific test>>.
--

. Start the WireMock server as shown in the following example:
+
--
.Example of starting a WireMock server
[source,java]
----
WireMockConfiguration config = WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig().dynamicPort(); <1>
WireMockServer wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(config); <2>
wireMockServer.start(); <3>
----
<1> Creates the configuration for the WireMock server. You can use a dynamic port since it prevents the tests from failing due to port conflicts. When you cannot use a dynamic port, you can use the `WireMockConfiguration#port(int)` method to use a fixed port number.
<2> Creates the WireMock server instance.
<3> Starts the WireMock server.
--

. Mock the endpoints as shown in the following example:
+
--
.Example of mocking endpoints
[source,java]
----
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
JsonNode greecePayload = objectMapper.readTree(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/country_mock.json")); <1>

wireMockServer.stubFor(WireMock.get(WireMock.urlEqualTo("/rest/v2/name/Greece")) <2>
                               .willReturn(WireMock.aResponse() <3>
                                                   .withStatus(200) <4>
                                                   .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json") <5>
                                                   .withJsonBody(greecePayload))); <6>
----
<1> Creates the JSON payload, which the WireMock server returns. Alternatively, you can use the `ResponseDefinitionBuilder#withBody` method to define a `String` or a `byte[]` as the response body.
<2> Defines a stub for the `/rest/v2/name/Greece` endpoint.
<3> Defines the response for the stub.
<4> Defines the response status.
<5> Defines the response headers.
<6> Defines the response body.

. Stop the WireMock server as shown in the following example:

[[proc-start-wiremock-server-quarkustestresource]]
=== Starting WireMock server as a `QuarkusTestResource`

In the process of adding a mocked OpenAPI service to your tests, you need to start the WireMock server. You can start the WireMock server either as a `QuarkusTestResource` or you can start the server for each test. 

The procedure in this section describes how you can start the WireMock server as a `QuarkusTestResource`. For more information about `QuarkusTestResource`, see link:{quarkus_test_resource_url}[Starting services before the Quarkus application starts] document.

.Prerequisites
include::../../pages/_common-content/getting-started-requirement.adoc[]

* WireMock dependency is added in the `pom.xml` file.

.Procedure
. Create a class that implements the `QuarkusTestResource` interface as shown in the following example:
+

<1> Starts the test resource. This method is called once before running all the tests.
<2> Returns a map of application properties that are set in the test environment. In this case, the `quarkus.rest-client.restcountries_json.url` property is set as the base URL of the WireMock server.
<3> Stops the test resource. This method is called once after running all the tests.

. Use the `QuarkusTestResource` implementation in your test class as shown in the following example:
