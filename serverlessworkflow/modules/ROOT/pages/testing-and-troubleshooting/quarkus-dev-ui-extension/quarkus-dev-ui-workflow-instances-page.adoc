In {product_name} Dev UI extension, the Workflow Instances page is used to monitor and manage the available instances. The Workflow Instances page displays a list of available instances and add filters to the list.

To create a workflow instance, you can use the Workflow Definitions page. For more information, see xref:testing-and-troubleshooting/quarkus-dev-ui-extension/quarkus-dev-ui-workflow-definition-page.adoc[Workflow Definitions in {product_name} Dev UI extension].

When you create a workflow instance, the instance appears in the workflow instances table on the page, containing the following details:

* *Id*: Displays the name and business key of an instance. Also, when you hover on the name of the workflow instance, a unique ID is displayed for the instance. You can click on the ID to navigate to the *Workflow Details* page.
* *Status*: Displays the current state of the instance. This column can contain *Active*, *Completed*, *Aborted*, *Error*, and *Suspended* as values.
* *Created*: Displays the time reference indicating when the instance is created.
* *Last Update*: Displays the time reference indicating when the instance is last updated.

You can also sort the columns of the workflow instances table.

On the Workflow Instances page, you can filter the list of workflow instances based on the states and business keys. By default, *Active*, *Completed*, *Aborted*, *Error*, and *Suspended* are applied on the list. You can use the *Status* drop-down to see the available states. To filter the workflow instances based on the states, select or unselect the states in the *Status* drop-down and click *Apply filter* button.

To filter the workflow instances based on business keys, enter a business key in the *Filter by business key* field and click *Apply filter* button.

.Example filters applied on the workflow instances

To fetch the newly added workflow instances, click on the refresh icon next to the *Apply Filter* button. Also, to clear the applied filters and reset to the default state, click *Reset to default* button.

== Opening the Workflow instance details

In the workflow instances table, the *Id* column contains a clickable link, which enables you to navigate to the *Workflow Details* page. The *Workflow Details* page contains various panels, providing detailed information about a workflow instance.

.Example Workflow Details page
image::testing-and-troubleshooting/quarkus-dev-ui-extension/kogito-swf-tools-workflow-details-page.png[]

The Workflow Details page consists of the following panels:

* Serverless Workflow Diagram panel
* Timeline panel
* Details panel
* Variables panel

Serverless Workflow Diagram panel::
+
--
The Serverless Workflow Diagram panel enables you to explore the workflow diagram and execution path of the workflow instance. The workflow diagram and execution path are displayed by consuming the source which is exposed through the `kogito-addons-quarkus-source-files`.

To add the source files add-on configuration, add the following dependency to `pom.xml` file of your project:

.source-files add-on dependency in `pom.xml` file
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-source-files</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is a slider available in the diagram panel, which when dragged to the right displays the source code in read-only mode.

The Timeline panel displays the list of nodes that are related to a workflow instance. Each node in the Timeline panel consists of an icon, indicating the state of the node, such as *Active*, *Completed*, or *Error*.

The Details panel displays the basic information related to a workflow instance, including:

* *Name*: Name of the workflow instance.
* *Business key*: Business key related to the workflow instance.
* *State*: Current state of the workflow instance.
* *Id*: Unique ID of the workflow instance.
* *Start*: Time reference indicating when the workflow instance is started.

== Sending Cloud Events to active Workflow Instances

The *Workflow Instances* page also allows you to send HTTP Cloud Events to the active workflow instances that are waiting for
an event to advance.

To do so you just have to click on the *Trigger Cloud Event* button that will lead you to the *Trigger Cloud Event* page.

Once there, you will have to fill out the form with the Cloud Event information:

- *Endpoint*: Defines the Path and the HTTP method where the cloud event should be triggered.
- *Event Type*: Sets the Cloud Event type header.
- *Event Source*: Sets the Cloud Event Source header. Defaults to `/local/quarkus-devUi`.
- *Instance Id*: Sets the id of the workflow instance that must receive the event, it will be added in the `kogitoprocrefid` event header.
- *Event Data*: Data that will be in the event in JSON format.

Additionally, you can use the *Send Cloud Event* action present available on the instance actions kebab. By using it you
will be lead to the *Trigger Cloud Event* page, but in this case the *Instance Id* field will be already filled with
the selected workflow id.

[NOTE]
====
To enable the actions kebab, make sure your project is configured to have the `kogito-addons-quarkus-process-management`
dependency on its `pom.xml` file, like:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-process-management</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Click the *Trigger* button to trigger the cloud event. If the event is successfully triggered, a success alert appears
at the top of the screen, which contains the *Go to workflow list* link to navigate to the xref:testing-and-troubleshooting/quarkus-dev-ui-extension/quarkus-dev-ui-workflow-instances-page.adoc[Workflow Instances page].

If there is an issue while sending the event, then a failure alert appears at the top of the screen, containing *View Details* and *Go to workflow list* options. The *View Details* enables you to view the error message.
