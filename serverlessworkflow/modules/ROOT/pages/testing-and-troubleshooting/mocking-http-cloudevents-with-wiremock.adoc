This document describes how you can test your workflow application that uses HTTP link:{cloud_events_url}[CloudEvents] and link:{knative_sink_binding_impl_url}[Knative SinkBinding].

The example described in this document is based on the link:{kogito_sw_order_processing_example_url}[`serverless-workflow-order-processing`] example application.

[[con-sinkbinding-test-overview]]
== Overview

The workflow application that you want to test must be configured to use link:{knative_eventing_url}[Knative Eventing]. You must configure Knative Eventing using standard HTTP POST requests to send and receive events between event producers and link:{knative_sink_binding_overview_url}[sinks]. The events between the event producers and sinks follow the link:{cloud_events_url}[CloudEvents] specification, which enables creating, parsing, sending, and receiving events in any programming language.

When you create an event source, you can specify a sink where events are sent to, from the source. A sink is a transferable or a callable resource that can receive incoming events from other resources. The examples of sink include Kubernetes deployments, Knative services, channels, and brokers.

This document describes the testing of Knative service that is configured as a sink, and the same Knative service is mocked to verify if the CloudEvents are received correctly by the sink. In this process, the link:{wiremock_url}[WireMock] framework adds the mocked server, verifying the CloudEvents received by the sink during the workflow service execution.

<1> `@QuarkusTest` starts the Quarkus server for the lifetime of the test execution run. For more information, see link:{recap_of_http_based_testing_in_jvm_mode_url}[Quarkus - Testing your application].
<2> The test name ends with `IT` to identify which test needs to be executed as an integration test. More details in link:{failsafe_pluggin_inclusions}[maven-failsafe-plugin] documentation.
<3> link:{wiremockserver_class_url}[`WireMockServer`] is a mocked server instance that is used for SinkBinding for testing.
<4> `given()` is used to test interactions with the application. For more information about testing interactions, see {basic_integration_test_with_restassured_guide}[Testing your workflow application using REST Assured].
<5> `@BeforeAll` annotation is used to signal that the annotated method must be executed before running all the tests.
<6> Creates a `WireMockServer` instance, listening at the port that is passed as a parameter and must match with the sink configuration.
<7> Starts the server before the tests are executed.
<8> Stubs the mocked API response. It accepts a `MappingBuilder` instance that is used to build API mapping information, such as URL, request parameters, body, headers, and authorization.
<9> `@AfterAll` annotation is used to signal that the annotated method must be executed after executing all the tests.
<10> Stops the server after executing all the tests.
<11> link:{awaitility_class_url}[`await()`] is added to wait for asynchronous operations.
<12> link:{wiremock_verifying_url}[`verify`] verifies if the request hits the mock API using the expected event content.

You can check the `VerifyWorkflowExecutionIT` class of link:{kogito_sw_order_processing_example_VerifyWorkflowExecutionIT_class_url}[`serverless-workflow-order-processing`] example application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Start the server before executing the tests, and stop the server once the tests are completed. You can also reset the mock stubs between the tests.

. Configure your test application to use the `WireMockServer` as a sink. 
+
--
Also, add the reference of `WireMockServer` in the `application.properties` file as shown in the following example:

.Example adding sink connection property in `application.properties` file
[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.url=http://0.0.0.0:8181 <1>
----
<1> The port that needs to match with the passed parameter. The parameter is passed when the `WireMockServer` is created in the test class.

For more information, see `application.properties` file of link:{kogito_sw_order_processing_example_test_application_properties_url}[`serverless-workflow-order-processing`] example application.

[[ref-example-test-execution-cycle]]
=== Example of test execution cycle

The testing example in this document is based on the link:{kogito_sw_order_processing_example_url}[`serverless-workflow-order-processing`] example application. The `serverless-workflow-order-processing` example application contains three workflows as shown in the following figure:

.Workflows in `serverless-workflow-order-processing` example
image::testing-and-troubleshooting/order-example-worflows.png[]

The *Order Workflow* in the `serverless-workflow-order-processing` example application processes the incoming order event and starts a parallel state, which sends requests to two workflows including *Fraud Handling* and *Shipping Handling*. The Order Workflow ends when both Fraud Handling and Shipping Handling workflows are completed.

The Fraud Handling workflow produces a `FraudEvaluation` event if the received order is more than 1000 USD. In the workflow architecture, any other system or service can read the `FraudEvaluation` event and react upon it, such as canceling the order. 

Simultaneously, regardless of evaluating the fraud, the Shipping Handling workflow produces events that classify the required shipping service, such as international or domestic. In this example, domestic shipping is classified for any order, containing the address within the United States. 

The following figure shows the event flow among the components in the `serverless-workflow-order-processing` example application:

.Example of event flow among components
image::testing-and-troubleshooting/example-components-interaction.png[]

Also, the testing components replicate the interactions to verify the events that are received by the sink as shown in the following figure:

.Example of testing events flow
image::testing-and-troubleshooting/testing-eventing-sink.png[]

Before executing a test, the `WireMockServer` starts listening to the configured port as the sink. The sink listens to the events that are produced by the workflows. When a workflow produces an event to the sink, the produced event is received by the `WireMockServer`, and then the test verifies the event content.

The `processDomesticOrderUnderFraudEval` in the <<testclass, `VerifyWorkflowExecutionIT`>> class, produces events, such as `fraudEvaluation` (`Total > 1000`) and `domesticShipping` (`country = "US"`). Also, the order event consumed by the Order Workflow needs to match the requirements as shown in the following example:

.Example requirements for Order Workflow
[source,java]
----
final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
final Order order = new Order();
order.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
order.setDescription("iPhone 12");
order.setTotal(1001);
order.setCountry("US");

given()
        .header("ce-specversion", "1.0")
        .header("ce-id", order.getId())
        .header("ce-source", "/from/test")
        .header("ce-type", "orderEvent")
        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        .body(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(order))
        .post("/")
        .then()
        .statusCode(200);
----

After matching the requirements, the test verifies if the sink is receiving the expected events as shown in the following example:

.Example of a sink verification
[source,java]
----
await()
        .atMost(60, SECONDS)
        .with().pollInterval(1, SECONDS)
        .untilAsserted(() -> {
            sink.verify(2, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/")).withRequestBody(containing(order.getId())));
            sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/")).withRequestBody(containing("\"type\":\"fraudEvaluation\"").and(containing("\"id\":\"" + order.getId() + "\""))));
            sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/")).withRequestBody(containing("\"type\":\"domesticShipping\"").and(containing("\"id\":\"" + order.getId() + "\""))));
        });
----

The `await()` method in the previous example allows the test to retry the validations until the verifications are declared or until the specified time is expired. In this example, the specified time is 60 seconds. 

The following example shows how to check if the sink (`WireMockServer`) receives two events for the same order ID:

.Example if sink receives the events
[source,java]
----
sink.verify(2, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/")).withRequestBody(containing(order.getId())));
----

To check the content of the received events, the following verifications can be declared or performed on the `types`:

.Example of verifications
[source,java]
----
sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/")).withRequestBody(containing("\"type\":\"fraudEvaluation\"").and(containing("\"id\":\"" + order.getId() + "\""))));
sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/")).withRequestBody(containing("\"type\":\"domesticShipping\"").and(containing("\"id\":\"" + order.getId() + "\""))));
----

After declaring the verifications on received events, the test successfully ends and the `WireMockServer` stops.
