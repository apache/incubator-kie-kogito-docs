Kogito Serverless Workflow generate metrics that can be consumed by Prometheus and visualized by dashboard tools such as link:{openshift_micrometer_url}[Openshift], link:{dashbuilder_url}[Dashbuilder] and link:{grafana_url}[Grafana].

This document describes how to enable and expose metrics to Prometheus.

== Enabling metrics

For adding metrics to your Serverless Workflow application just add the dependency `org.kie.kogito:kogito-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus` and the metrics will be available in `/q/metrics` URL.

.Dependency to be added to `pom.xml` to enable metrics
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
    <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>

== Consuming metrics from Openshift

If your Serverless Workflow server is running on Openshift you can use it to monitor your application.

To consume metrics from Openshift you must first link:{openshift_monitoring_url}[enable monitoring for user-defined projects]. Then you need to create a service monitor. Here's a sample configuration:


.service-monitor.yaml:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: prometheus-app-monitor
  name: prometheus-app-monitor
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    targetPort: 8080
    path: /q/metrics
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app-with-metrics: 'serverless-workflow-app'
----

Then apply it:

[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f service-monitor.yaml
----

What we have just done is to create a Service Monitor named `prometheus-app-monitor` that will select apps with the label selector `app-with-metrics: serverless-workflow-app`, make sure that your Serverless Workflow application has this label. Then, OpenShift will call the endpoint `/q/metrics` for all the services labeled with  `app-with-metrics: serverless-workflow-app` every 30 seconds. For more details check the link:{openshift_micrometer_url}:[Monitoring Quarkus apps using Micrometer and Prometheus into OpenShift] guide.


== Consuming metrics from Prometheus

Prometheus can scrap metrics from a Kogito Serverless Workflow application using the following configuration:

.Prometheus Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
- job_name: 'Serverless Workflow App'
    scrape_interval: 2s
    metrics_path: /q/metrics
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:8080']
----

You can edit `job_name` and `scrap_interval` as you want. Make sure that `targets` under `static_configs` match your Serverless Workflow application location.

== Understanding Kogito Serverless Workflow Metrics

For Serverless Workflow we will be looking into the following metrics:

* *kogito_process_instance_completed_total*: Completed Workflows
* *kogito_process_instance_started_total*: Started Workflows
* *kogito_process_instance_running_total*: Running Workflows
* *kogito_process_instance_duration_seconds_sum*: Workflows Total Duration 

[NOTE]
====
Internally, Workflows are referenced as process hence the fields `processId` and `processName` are actually the workflow id and name.
====


Each of these metrics will have a label for the specific workflow id. See how the metric `kogito_process_instance_completed_total` for workflows `jsongreet`, `yamlgreet` and `foreach` looks like:

[source,yaml]
----
# HELP kogito_process_instance_completed_total Completed Process Instances
# TYPE kogito_process_instance_completed_total counter
kogito_process_instance_completed_total{app_id="default-process-monitoring-listener",artifactId="kogito-serverless-workflow-demo",node_name="2",process_id="jsongreet",version="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT",} 154.0
kogito_process_instance_completed_total{app_id="default-process-monitoring-listener",artifactId="kogito-serverless-workflow-demo",node_name="2",process_id="yamlgreet",version="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT",} 218.0
kogito_process_instance_completed_total{app_id="default-process-monitoring-listener",artifactId="kogito-serverless-workflow-demo",node_name="2",process_id="foreach",version="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT",} 162.0
----

[NOTE]
====
Kogito internally uses Quarkus Micrometer extension, which means that it also expose some built-in metrics. You can disable Micrometer metrics as described in link:quarkus_micrometer_url[Quarkus Micrometer Guide].
