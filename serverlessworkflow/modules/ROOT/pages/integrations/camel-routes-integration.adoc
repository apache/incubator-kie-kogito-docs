= Integrating with Camel routes

{context} can integrate with link:{camel_url}[Apache Camel Routes] by adding the Kogito Quarkus Camel Add-on to your project. It enables the workflow engine to identify and call Camel routes declared in YAML or XML in the same workflow project context.

[[proc-enable-quarkus-camel]]
== Enabling Quarkus Camel in {context}

You can enable Quarkus Camel in your project.

.Prerequisites
* A workflow application is created. 
+
For more information about creating a workflow, see xref:getting-started/create-your-first-workflow-service.adoc[Creating your first workflow service].

.Procedure
. To add the Quarkus Camel to your workflow application, add the `org.kie.kogito:kogito-addons-quarkus-camel` dependency to the `pom.xml` file of your project as follows:
+

== Creating Camel routes in {context}

You can add YAML or XML Camel routes to your workflow project.

.Procedure
. Create a YAML or XML Camel Routes using your IDE or the link:{kaoto_url}[Kaoto VSCode Editor] and place them in the `src/main/resources/routes` directory.
. The route `from` endpoint must be a `direct` component. That's the endpoint producer expected by the workflow engine.
. The route response must be in a valid format that the workflow context can understand:
+
include::../../pages/_common-content/camel-valid-responses.adoc[]

The response will be merged into the workflow state context. If it is an array or a complex object, the response will be added to the special attribute `response`.

.Example of a Camel route with the `direct` endpoint returning a valid JSON string representation
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:logRouteReplaceHeader <1>
    steps: <2>
      - setBody:
          simple: '{ "id": "${header.WorkflowID}", "arg1": { "arg2": "value1" } }' <3>
      - log:
          message: We received the ${body} <4>
----

<1> Camel route producer definition using the `direct` component
<2> Definition of the Camel route steps
<3> Replace the Camel message body with a valid JSON object containing the header `WorkflowID` from the workflow context
<4> Log the Camel message body in the console for debugging purposes.

== Defining and referencing Camel functions in the Workflow DSL

You can define and reference your Camel functions in the workflow definition.

.Prerequisites
* You have created Camel routes in the workflow Maven project.

.Procedure
. In the `functions` definition section of your workflow DSL, declare the Camel route as exemplified below:
+
.Example of a Camel Route function definition
[source,json]
----
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "logRoute",
      "type": "custom",
      "operation": "camel:direct:logRouteReplaceHeader"
    }
  ]
}
----
+
The operation description must have the prefix `camel:direct:`, indicating that you want to produce a message to this route via the link:{camel_extensions_url}/direct.html[Camel Direct Component]. Direct is the only component supported by {context} at the moment.
+
The `operation` suffix contains the name of the route endpoint. In the case of this example, `logRouteReplaceHeader`.
+
[WARNING]
====
The Camel route defined in the workflow must be available in your project during runtime, otherwise, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.
====
+
. To use the Camel function definition in a workflow action, you can simply reference it as you normally would with any other {context} function definitions. For example:
+

[source,json]
----
{
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "sendToLog",
      "type": "operation",
      "actions": [
        {
          "functionRef": {
            "refName": "logRoute", <1>
            "arguments": {
              "body": "${ . }", <2>
              "headers": {
                "WorkflowID": "$WORKFLOW.instanceId" <3>
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "end": true
    }
  ]
}
----
+
<1> The function reference name, as defined in the function attribute.
<2> The body definition. A `jq` expression to be evaluated in runtime resulting in the body payload.
<3> The `headers` definition that must be a key/value pair or a valid `jq` expression evaluated in runtime.
+
Once a message is received back from the Camel route, the data is merged into the workflow payload:

== Example project

There is an link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-camel-routes[example project available on GitHub] using this new feature. You can use it as a reference to have a better understanding of the Camel integration with {context}.
