This document describes how you add an Ingress to a {product_name} workflow to handle authentication and authorization use cases.

In the approach outlined in this guide, protect your workflows from anonymous access outside the cluster with the link:{oidc_spec_url}[OpenID Connect] specification. 

Although the example demonstrated in this document is not meant to be used in production, you can use it as a reference to create your own architecture.

== Architecture

The following image illustrates a simplified architecture view of the recommended approach for protecting {product_name} workflow endpoints.

image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/ingress-apisix-keycloak.png[]

1. User makes a request with their credentials
2. APISIX do the JWT token introspection in the OIDC Server (Keycloak)
3. Keycloak validates the token
4. APISIX forwards the request to the workflow application

This is a simplified approach for OIDC (OpenID Connect protocol) use cases. In production environments, you can tailor your gateway and OIDC server to meet your requirements and scope.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This approach only protects the communication via Ingress. Direct calls to the workflow application link:{kubernetes_svc_url}[internal service] would be anonymous.
For example, another microservice in the cluster making requests to the workflow internal service.
Set link:{kubernetes_networkpolicy_url}[Kuberbetes NetworkPolicies] to your workflow applications if this is not the desired behavior.
====

== How to deploy the example architecture

The following sections describe how to deploy the example architecture using APISIX and Keycloak to protect your {product_name} workflows.

.Prerequisites

* Minikube is installed. You can use Kind or any other cluster if you have admin access. Just ensure to adapt the steps below to your environment.
* link:{sonataflow_apisix_example_url}[Clone the example SonataFlow APISIX with Keycloak in a local directory].
* (Optional) xref:cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.adoc[{operator_name} is installed] if you are going to deploy via the operator.
* (Optional) xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/deployments/deploying-on-minikube.adoc[Quarkus {product_name} workflow is deployed] if you are not using the operator.

=== Installing Keycloak

From the example's cloned directory 'sonataflow-apisix-oidc', run the following command:

.Running kustomize to install Keycloak
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create ns keycloak
kubectl kustomize manifests/bases | kubectl apply -f - -n keycloak
----

This command creates a namespace called `keycloak` and a Keycloak server deployment connected to a PostgreSQL database to persist your data across cluster restarts.

==== Exposing Keycloak locally

[TIP]
====
You can skip this section if you are running on OpenShift or any cluster that you can expose Keycloak via an Ingress DNS or Route.
====

Since Keycloak is running on Minikube, expose the service port to your local network by running the following command:

.Exposing Keycloak to the local network
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods -l app=keycloak --output=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' -n keycloak) 8080:8080 -n keycloak
----

From now on, every connection to the `8080` port is forwarded to the Keycloak service endpoint.

The next step is to configure your local `/etc/hosts`. This step is needed because the token you are going to generate must come from the same URL that the APISIX server introspects once you access the workflow.

Edit your local `/etc/hosts` file and add the following line:

.Hosts file with the Keycloak address entry
[source,txt,subs="attributes+"]
----
127.0.0.1 keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local
----

You can try accessing your Keycloak admin console in the address link:http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080[]. The default user and password are `admin`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In real-life environments, this step is not needed since Keycloak or any OIDC server is served by a load balancer with the correct address configured.
====

==== Configuring the Keycloak OIDC Server

In the next step, log in to the Keycloak admin console in the address link:http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080[] using the default credentials.

Once you are logged into the console, click *Create realm* in the top left menu. In this screen, create a new realm named `sonataflow`. See the image below for more details:

.Creation of the new sonataflow realm
image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/01-create-realm.png[]

Next, create a client for the APISIX Ingress to introspect the JWT tokens.

In the left menu, make sure that you are in the `sonataflow` realm and click on *Clients*, then *Create client*. Give the name `apisix-ingress` and then click on *Next*.

.Creation of the APISIX Ingress client
image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/02-create-client.png[]

Next, add the details about this client:

1. Turn the *Client authentication* option on.
2. Leave *Authorization* off.
3. Mark the options *Standard flow* and *Direct access grants* and leave the rest blank.

.APISIX Ingress client details
image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/03-create-client.png[]

Click on *Next*, leave everything blank in the next screen and click on *Save*.

==== Creating a user

In this example, create a user registered in the Keycloak server to access the workflow application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For simplicity, use the link:{keycloak_resource_owner_granttype_url}[Grant Type Resource Owner Password]. This flow is not recommended for production architectures. Consider using other mechanisms such as Authorization Code or Client Credentials.
====

In the left menu, make sure that you are in the `sonataflow` realm and click on *Users* and then click *Create new user*.

In this screen, fill in the details according to the figure below:

1. Switch *Email verified* option on.
2. Set *Username* to `luke`.
3. Set *Email* to `luke@republic.org`
4. Set *First name* to `Luke` and *Last name* to `Skywalker`

.Creating a workflow user
image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/05-create-user.png[]

Click on *Create*.

Next, set the credentials for this newly created user. Click on *Users* in the left menu and then in the name `luke`. 

In this screen, click on the tab *Credentials*, and then on *Set password*.

.Setting user's password
image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/06-user-set-password.png[]

Set the password as `luke` (same as the username), leave the *Temporary* option off and click on *Save*.

Use the credentials `luke`/`luke` later in this guide to acquire a JWT token to make requests to the workflow application.

=== Installing the APISIX Ingress

Follow the documentation on link:{apisix_install_url}[APISIX Documentation website] and install the APISIX Ingress in your cluster (install the HELM client first).

If you are running on Minikube, expose the APISIX Ingress server:

.Exposing apisix-ingress service to the local network
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix
----

The command outcome is the local URL which you can access the Ingress you create later in this guide. Leave the terminal open.

[TIP]
====
If you are not running on Minikube, see the APISIX Ingress documentation for more information on how to expose the Ingress already in your cluster. 
====

After this step, Keycloak OIDC Server and APISIX Ingress Controller on your cluster are able to protect your {product_name} workflow applications from external requests.

== Deploying the {product_name} sample workflow

In this section, learn how to deploy the Greeting workflow example and a custom APIXSIX Ingress to protect external requests to the application's endpoints.

.Prerequisites

* You installed, configured, and exposed the Keycloak server
* You installed and exposed the APISIX Ingress server
* You installed the {operator_name} 
* You link:{sonataflow_apisix_example_url}[cloned the example application locally]

The first step is to deploy the {product_name} workflow. 

Enter the example project directory that you cloned locally and run the command below:

.Deploying the Greeting workflow
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create ns sonataflow
kubectl apply -f workflow-app/01-sonataflow-greeting.yaml -n sonataflow
----

You can follow the workflow deployment by running

.Follow the workflow deployment process
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl -n sonataflow get workflow/greeting -w

NAME       PROFILE   VERSION   URL   READY   REASON
greeting             0.0.1           False   WaitingForBuild
----

=== Configuring the Ingress Route

Once you deploy the {product_name} workflow you can configure and deploy the APISIX Route.

Open the file `workflow-app/02-sonataflow-route.yaml` in the example application you cloned earlier and change the credentials for the `apisix-ingress` client that you created in the Keycloak server:

.Greeting workflow APISIX Route
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v2
kind: ApisixRoute
metadata:
  name: sonataflow
spec:
  http:
    - name: greeting
      match:
        hosts:
          - local.greeting.sonataflow.org
        paths:
          - "/*"
      backends:
        - serviceName: greeting
          servicePort: 80
      plugins:
        - name: openid-connect <1>
          enable: true
          config:
            client_id: apisix-ingress
            client_secret: <2>
            discovery: http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/sonataflow/.well-known/openid-configuration
            scope: profile email
            bearer_only: true
            realm: sonataflow
            introspection_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post
----

<1> The link:{}[OpenID Connect plugin] to make the Ingress connect to Keycloak
<2> The `apisix-ingress` client credential to be changed

Open the Keycloak server (link:http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080[]) and in the realm `sonataflow` click on *Clients*, and then on `apisix-ingress`.

Click on the tab *Credentials* and copy the *Client Secret*:

.Creating the workflow user
image::cloud/apisix-keycloak/04-client-credentials.png[]

Paste the *Client Secret* into the `ApisixRoute` file `workflow-app/02-sonataflow-route.yaml` in the example application and run:

.Deploy the `ApisixRoute`
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f workflow-app/02-sonataflow-route.yaml -n sonataflow
----

To this point, you have installed in your cluster the Keycloak and APISIX Ingress server, and deployed the example Greeting workflow application.

=== Accessing the Workflow

Access the workflow without a token to see a rejection:

.Directly accessing the workflow without a token
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
INGRESS_URL= <1>

curl -v POST $\{INGRESS_URL\}/greeting -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Host: local.greeting.sonataflow.org" --data '{ "name": "Luke" }' 
----

<1> The ingress url is accessible via the Minikube service command. If you have not done it already, run `minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix`.

See a 401 HTTP Status message denying your access to the workflow.

Next, access the application using an access token. First, you need to get the access token from the Keycloak server:

.Requesting an access token to Keycloak server
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
CLIENT_SECRET="secret from apisix-ingress client" <1>

ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl \
  -d "client_id=apisix-ingress" \
  -d "client_secret=$\{CLIENT_SECRET\}" \
  -d "username=luke" \
  -d "password=luke" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  "http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/sonataflow/protocol/openid-connect/token" | jq -r .access_token) <2>
----

<1> Copy the secret from the `apisix-ingress` client
<2> Request an access token from the Keycloak server using the user `luke` credentials

[NOTE]
====
The token returned with the command above has a default timeout of 5 minutes, which means that if you take too long to use it, or want to execute several requests, you might need to execute the command again and get a new token.
====
Having the access token set in an environment variable, access the application again:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
INGRESS_URL= <1>

curl -v POST $\{INGRESS_URL\}/greeting -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Host: local.greeting.sonataflow.org" -H "Authorization: Bearer $\{ACCESS_TOKEN\}" --data '{ "name": "Luke" }' 
----

<1> The ingress url is accessible via the Minikube service command. If you have not done it already, run `minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix`.

This request is passing through the APISIX Gateway, which is validating the token via the `Authorization: Bearer` header. Then the request is passed internally to the workflow application which process and return to the original client.

Finally, this time, in the last part of the command output, you should see a JSON document similar to the excerpt below, which indicates that the workflow instance was created successfully.

[source,json]
----
{"id":"a9fc1a97-e274-4e40-80e5-4ff5ba203231","workflowdata":{"message":"Hello from YAML Workflow, anonymous"}}
----

== Conclusion

In this guide you were able to deploy an architecture of services capable of authenticating a valid user using OIDC mechanisms. Now, everytime that someone needs access to the deployed workflow, it must first get a valid JWT token in the Keycloak OIDC Server.

Next steps now, would be to tailor this architecture for your needs such as a cluster of Keycloak servers behind a TLS and valid domain. Also, APISIX Ingress offers many other capabilities and configurations that can be tuned to favor your use cases.
