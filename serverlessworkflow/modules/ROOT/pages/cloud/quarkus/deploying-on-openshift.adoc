This document describes how to deploy a {product_name} application using a OpenShift cluster, along with a procedure to run the OpenShift Serverless Operator, which is based on Knative.

.Prerequisites
* Your xref:cloud/quarkus/build-workflow-image-with-quarkus-cli.adoc[{product_name} application] is ready to use.
* link:{ocp_cli_url}[OpenShift CLI] is installed.
* link:{ocp_kn_cli_url}[Knative CLI] is installed.
* xref:testing-and-troubleshooting/kn-plugin-workflow-overview.adoc[Knative CLI workflow plugin] is installed.
* link:{podman_install_url}[Podman] +
If you are using link:{docker_install_url}[Docker], you might need to update the commands accordingly.
* (Optional) link:{quarkus_cli_url}[Quarkus CLI] is installed.

For the following steps we will be using the link:{ocp_local_url}[OpenShift Local]. However, the steps described here can be used on any OpenShift 4.x version that has support for OpenShift Serverless.

[[proc-install-openshift-local]]
== Installing OpenShift Local

_If you already have an OpenShift cluster available you can skip this section._

Instructions to install Openshift Local can be found {ocp_local_url_install}[here].

Once you have OpenShift Local running, proceed to the next topic.
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running OpenShift Local on Mac with M1 processors, you might not find the OpenShift Serverless Operator available.
====

Before proceeding further, make sure that you have access to the OpenShift cluster, the OpenShift Serverless operator is properly installed and the `Knative Serving` is ready for use. For more information on each topic, please refer the following guides:

* Installing link:{ocp_swf_install_url}[OpenShift Serverless Operator].
* Installing link:{ocp_knative_serving_url}[Knative Serving].
* Installing link:{ocp_knative_eventing_url}[Knative Eventing]. Knative Eventing is not required for this guide, however it is important to mention how to install it, if required by your {product_name} application.


[TIP]
====
If you get error messages related to `Istio`, this link:{knative_istio_issue_url}[article] might be helpful.

[[proc-deploy-sw-application-openshift]]
== Deploying your workflow application on OpenShift

Once `Knative Serving` is ready, you can initiate the process of deploying your {product_name} application on OpenShift.

// shared app req
include::../common/_deploy_workflow_application_requisites.adoc[]

After checking the prerequisites, prepare the project that will be used to deploy your application:

.Procedure
. Create project
+
--
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
{command_line_tool} new-project {default_namespace}
----
--
+
. Set the Kubernetes context to the newly created namespace using the following command:
+
--
.Set OpenShift current project
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
{command_line_tool} project {default_namespace}
----
--


[TIP]
====
You can use the link:build-workflow-image-with-quarkus-cli.html#proc-building-serverless-workflow-application-using-native-image[native image] for a faster startup.
====


=== Preparing the OpenShift's Registry
OpenShift comes with a registry where you can push your images built locally to be deployed.

First, let's check if the Registry is already exposed, to do that, check if the route is exposed:

.Check whether the OpenShift registry is exposed
[source,shell]
----
oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}'
----

If no information or an error is returned, it does mean that the registry is not exposed. To expose the registry follow link:{ocp_expose_registry_url}[these] steps.

Now that we have the OpenShift registry exposed, let's store into the `OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable, so we can use it easily in the next steps:

.Retrieve the OpenShift registry
[source,shell]
----
OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
----

The OpenShift's registry requires you to be logged in to be allowed to push Container Images. If you are already logged in the cluster you can use your token to authenticate to the OpenShift's registry:

.Log in to the OpenShift's registry
[source,shell]
----
podman login -u <USERNAME> -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL
----
If everything is working, you should get the *Login Succeeded!* message.

.Pushing {product_name} Application To OpenShift's registry
First step, get the Container Image tag built previously:
[source,shell]
----
podman images
----

With the Container Image, use the following command to tag the application image with the OpenShift's registry and
the namespace being used:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
podman tag <IMAGE_TAG> $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL/{default_namespace}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0
----

Then, push:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
podman push $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL/{default_namespace}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {default_namespace} is the current project/namespace created earlier to deploy your {product_name} application.
====

The next step is to deploy your workflow application and execute it.
You can read further the next sections which explain different approaches to deploy your {product_name} application:

[NOTE]
====
In the next steps you will notice the value **{k8s_registry}** being used. It is the internal OpenShift's registry address where the images of the deployments will pulled from. Note that, the Container Image pushed in the previous step will be queried as  `{k8s_registry}/{default_namespace}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0`
