The Kubernetes Service Discovery allows you to have a static URI that defines a Kubernetes resource that will be used
to perform HTTP requests. The resource defined in the URI will then be queried in the current Kubernetes cluster and
translated to a valid URL. The service discovery feature works during the Application startup, it scans all Quarkus
configuration in search of the following URI pattern. Thus, you should keep in mind that, if the startup time matters to you, then you should consider to use a static URL instead.
The following sketch demonstrates how this URI is composed:

[source,shell]
----
kubernetes:<group>/<version>/<kind>/<namespace>/<resourceName>?<attributeName>=<attributeValue>
\________/ \_____/ \_______/ \____/ \_________/ \____________/ \______________________________/
  scheme    group   version   kind   namespace   resourceName   additional resource attributes
            \____________________/                               \__________________________/
                     GVK                                           Supported values:
                                                                   - port-name={PORT_NUMBER}
                                                                   - labels=label-name=label-value;other-label=other-value
----

The following scheme values are supported:

* **kubernetes**
* **openshift**
* **knative**


For the Kubernetes GVK, the following resources are currently supported:

* **v1/service**
* **serving.knative.dev/v1/service**
* **v1/pod**
* **apps/v1/deployment**
* **apps.openshift.io/v1/deploymentconfig**
* **apps/v1/statefulset**
* **route.openshift.io/v1/route**
* **networking.k8s.io/v1/ingress**

[IMPORTANT]
====
The **Kubernetes GVK** (Group, Version and Kind) is **mandatory** and can't be empty, otherwise,
the engine will throw a validation issue and the discovery will not be performed. The last value in the URI
will always be considered as **Resource Name**.
The **Namespace** is **optional**. In case of an empty value, the current namespace or context will be used.
====

=== Additional Query Parameters

Also known as Query String, they are defined in the very same way that we are already used to do with URLs to assign value
to specific attributes.

Two query parameters are available to help the engine to be more precise when querying for the given Kubernetes Resource:

* **Custom Labels**: Useful to filter services in case there are more than one Service with the same `Label Selector`
but exposing different ports. In this case we can instruct the engine that, when more than 1 service is found, it should use the one
that have the provided label. The label is defined with the following expression, for multiple labels use `semicolon`:
** `labels=label-name=namevalue;another-label=another-value` +
    Example:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubernetes:v1/pod/<namespace>/<pod-name>?labels=label-name=test-label
----
*** With the URI above we will instruct that, if there are more than 1 service exposing the given pod, the label
`label-name=test-label` will be used to filter the service. If the label does not exist, the first found service will be used.

* **Custom port name**: Useful to determine which port to use when there are many ports configured in the target Service or Container.
It can be configured using the following patter:
** `port-name=<PORT_NAME>`: the port name to be queried.


== Configuration

There is no specific configuration for the Discovery to work properly except by using the expected URI pattern.
However, the okhttp communication interceptor, which logs the communication between the application and the Kubernetes API is disabled by default. +
If there is a need to debug it, it can be enabled just by setting this application property:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus.log.category."okhttp3.OkHttpClient".level=INFO
----


== How does it work?

During application startup, the service discovery is performed at the Quarkus _STATIC_INIT_ time. +
First, it scans the Quarkus configuration values and searches for the Kubernetes URI pattern. +
Then if at least one is found, the engine will parse the URI, query the Kubernetes API for the given resource, and override the given property.

Suppose we have an application that will consume a resource running on Kubernetes. This resource is a Knative Service that exposes a function that can be discovered with the following URI:


[source,shell]
----
org.kie.kogito.sw.knative.service=knative:v1/Service/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus/greeting-quarkus-cli
----

[NOTE]
====
The application property _name_ is not read by the service discovery engine, only property _value_.
====

Once the application has started, you should be able to see in the logs the Kubernetes Service Discovery into action:

[source,shell]

[NOTE]
====
Note that the URI was translated to `http://greeting-quarkus-cli.serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus.10.99.154.147.sslip.io` when the application started, and will be used at runtime any time it needs it.
====
== Discovery Precedence

Depending on the resource to be discovered, there are some paths to follow, please see the following image for more details:

image::cloud/sw-discovery-flow.jpg[]


== Startup time: discovery enabled x disabled

As the Service Discovery scans the Quarkus Configurations during the startup, it can cause a small delay as shown below:

[tabs]
====
Service Discovery Enabled::
+
[source,shell]
----
(main) sw-service-discovery 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 999-SNAPSHOT) started in 2.360s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
----
Service Discovery Disabled::
+
[source,shell]
----
(main) sw-service-discovery 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 999-SNAPSHOT) started in 1.507s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using this feature, you need to balance if the delayed startup time is something that your application can afford. +
If the URI pattern is not found in the Application Properties, the discovery will not be triggered. However, the scanning will still be performed anyway. So a very short time will be needed to go through the startup scan.

But, you can still fully disable the Kubernetes Service Discovery by excluding the `kogito-addons-quarkus-kubernetes` library from the Application's classpath. It can be done with the following maven exclusions:

[source,shell]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow</artifactId>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-kubernetes</artifactId>

    <exclusion>
