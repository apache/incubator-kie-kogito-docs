This document describes how to build and deploy your workflow on a cluster using the link:{kogito_serverless_operator_url}[{operator_name}] only by having a `SonataFlow` custom resource.

Every time you need to change the workflow definition the system will (re)build a new immutable version of the workflow. If you're still in development phase, please see the xref:cloud/operator/developing-workflows.adoc[] guide.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The build system implemented by the {operator_name} is not suitable for complex production use cases. Consider using an external tool to build your application such as Tekton and ArgoCD. The resulting image can then be deployed with `SonataFlow` custom resource. See more at xref:cloud/operator/customize-podspec.adoc#custom-image-default-container[Setting a custom image in the default container] section in the xref:cloud/operator/customize-podspec.adoc#custom-image-default-container[] guide.
====

Follow the <<building-kubernetes, Kubernetes>> or <<building-openshift, OpenShift>> sections of this document based on the cluster you wish to build your workflows on.

.Prerequisites
* A Workflow definition.
* The {operator_name} installed. See xref:cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.adoc[] guide

[#configure-build-system]
== Configuring the build system

The operator can build workflows on Kubernetes or OpenShift. On Kubernetes, it uses link:{kaniko_url}[Kaniko] and on OpenShift a link:{openshift_build_url}[standard BuildConfig]. The operator build system is not tailored for advanced production use cases and you can do only a few customizations.

=== Using another Workflow base builder image

If your scenario has strict policies for image usage, such as security or hardening constraints, you can replace the default image used by the operator to build the final workflow container image. Alternatively, you might want to test a nightly build with a bug fix or a custom image containing your customizations.

By default, the operator will use the image distributed upstream to build workflows. You can change this image by editing the `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource in the namespace where you deployed your workflows:

.Patching the current SonataFlowPlatform with the new builder image
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
# use `kubectl get sonataflowplatform` to get the SonataFlowPlatform name
kubectl patch sonataflowplatform <name> --patch  'spec:\n    build:\n    config:\n    baseImage: <your new image full name with tag>' -n <your_namespace>
----

=== Customize the base build Dockerfile

The operator uses the sonataflow-operator-builder-config `ConfigMap` in the operator's installation namespace ({operator_installation_namespace}) to configure and run the workflow build process. 
You can change the `Dockerfile` entry in this `ConfigMap` to tailor the Dockerfile to your needs. Just be aware that this can break the build process.

.Example of the sonataflow-operator-builder-config `ConfigMap`

----

[WARNING]
====
The excerpt above is just an example. The current version might have a slightly different version. Don't use this example in your installation.
====

=== Changing resources requirements

You can create or edit a `SonataFlowPlatform` in the workflow namespace specifying the link:{kubernetes_resource_management_url}[resources requirements] for the internal builder pods:

.Example of SonataFlowPlatform
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform
spec:
  build:
    template:
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
----

Every build process will reuse this configuration and start new instances based on it from now on.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only one `SonataFlowPlatform` is allowed per namespace. Try fetching the one the operator created for you and edit it instead of trying to create another one.
====

You can fine tune the resources requirements for a particular workflow. Every workflow instance will have a `SonataFlowBuild` instance created with the same name as the workflow. You can edit the `SonataFlowBuild` custom resource and specify the same parameters. For example:

.Example of SonataFlowBuild
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowBuild
metadata:
  name: my-workflow
spec:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
----

This parameters will only apply to new build instances.

=== Passing arguments to the internal builder

You can pass build arguments (see link:{docker_doc_arg_url}[Dockerfile ARG]) to the `SonataFlowBuild` instance.

.Procedure

1. Create or edit an existing `SonataFlowBuild` instance. It has the same name of the `SonataFlow` you're trying to build.
+
.Checking if the SonataFlowBuild instance already exists
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl edit sonataflowbuild/<name> -n <namespace>
----
+
2. Add to the `.spec.buildArgs` the desired arguments.
+
.Adding buildArgs to the SonataFlowBuild instance
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowBuild
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  [...]
  buildArgs:
    - name: ARG1
      value: value1
    - name: ARG2
      value: value2
----
+
3. Save the file and exit. A new build should start soon with the new configuration.

Alternatively, you can set this information in the `SonataFlowPlatform`, so that every new build instance will use it as a template. For example:

.Example of a SonataFlowPlatform instance with default build args for every build within the namespace
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  build:
    template:
      buildArgs:
        - name: ARG1
          value: value1
        - name: ARG2
          value: value2
----

[TIP]
====
Since the `buildArgs` attribute is an array of link:{kubernetes_envvar_url}[Kubernetes `EnvVar` object], you can refer to a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` to pass this value, for example. You're not restricted by a plain value. 

On Minikube and Kubernetes only plain values, `ConfigMap` and `Secret` are supported due to a restriction on the build system provided by these platforms.
====

The table below lists the Dockerfile arguments available in the default {operator_name} installation:

.Default ARG definitions in the builder Dockerfile
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Argument | Description | Example

|QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS | List of link:{quarkus_extensions_url}[Quarkus Extensions] separated by comma that the builder should add to the workflow. | org.kie.kogito:kogito-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc:999-SNAPSHOT
|QUARKUS_ADD_EXTENSION_ARGS | Arguments passed to the Quarkus CLI when adding extensions. Enabled only when `QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS` is not empty. | See the link:{quarkus_cli_url}#using-the-cli[Quarkus CLI documentation]
|MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND | Arguments passed to the maven build when the workflow build is produced. | -Dkogito.persistence.type=jdbc -Dquarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql
|===

=== Setting environment variables in the internal builder

You can set environment variables to the `SonataFlowBuild` internal builder pod. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
These environment variables are valid for the build context **only**. They are not set on the final built workflow image.
====

.Procedure

1. Create or edit an existing `SonataFlowBuild` instance. It has the same name of the `SonataFlow` you're trying to build.
+
.Checking if the SonataFlowBuild instance already exists
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl edit sonataflowbuild/<name> -n <namespace>
----
+
2. Add to the `.spec.envs` the desired data.
+
.Setting environment variables in the SonataFlowBuild instance
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08

  [...]
  envs:
    - name: MYENV1
      value: value1
    - name: MYENV2
      value: value2
----
+
3. Save the file and exit. A new build should start soon with the new configuration.

Alternatively, you can set this information in the `SonataFlowPlatform`, so that every new build instances will use it as a template. For example:

.Example of a SonataFlowPlatform instance with default envs for every build within the namespace

        - name: MYENV1
          value: value1
        - name: MYENV2
          value: value2
----

[TIP]
====
Since the `envs` attribute is an array of link:{kubernetes_envvar_url}[Kubernetes `EnvVar` object], you can refer to a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` to pass this value, for example. You're not restricted by a plain value. 

On Minikube and Kubernetes only plain values, `ConfigMap` and `Secret` are supported due to a restriction on the build system provided by these platforms.
====

[#building-kubernetes]
== Building on Kubernetes

[TIP]
====
You can skip this section if you're running <<building-openshift, on OpenShift>>.
====

Follow these steps to configure your Kubernetes namespace to build workflow images with the operator.

=== Create a Namespace for the building phase

Create a new namespace that will hold all the resources that the operator will create (Pods, Deployments, Services, Secrets, ConfigMap, and Custom Resources) in this guide.

.Create a Namespace for the workflow to build and run in
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create namespace workflows
# set the workflows namespace to your context
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=workflows
----

=== Create a Secret for the container registry authentication

You can follow these steps to publish on external registry that requires authentication. If you're running on Minikube, just link:{minikube_registry_url}[enable the internal registry]. You can skip this whole section since the internal Minikube registry doesn't require authentication.

.Create a secret for the container registry authentication
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=<registry_username> --docker-password=<registry_password> --docker-email=<registry_email> -n workflows
----

or you can directly import your local Docker config into your Kubernetes cluster:

.Create a Secret for the container registry authentication based on local Docker config
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create secret generic regcred --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=$\{HOME\}/.docker/config.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson -n workflows
----

[WARNING]
====
Double-check your `$\{HOME\}/.docker/config.json`. If you're using local desktop authentication, this configuration **won't work** in the cluster. You can initialize this by logging in to the target registry, e.g. `docker login`.
====

=== Configure the {operator_name} (i.e. registry address, secret) for building your Workflows

The `SonataFlowPlatform` is the Custom Resource used to control the behavior of the {operator_name}.
It defines the behavior of the operator when handling all {product_name} Custom Resources (Workflow and Build) in the given namespace.

Since the operator is installed in global mode, you will need to specify a `SonataFlowPlatform` in each Namespace where you want to deploy Workflows.

[TIP]
====
If you have deployed a workflow for xref:cloud/operator/developing-workflows.adoc[development] you already have a `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource since the operator created one for you. Just edit the one you have.
====

Following is a very basic `SonataFlowPlatform` Custom Resource example to work on Kubernetes:

.Example of a basic SonataFlowPlatform on Kubernetes
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform
spec:
  build:
    config:
      strategyOptions:
        KanikoBuildCacheEnabled: "true"
      registry:
        address: quay.io/kiegroup <1>
        secret: regcred <2>
----

<1> Your registry address
<2> The secret name created in the steps above

On Minikube, you can remove the `registry` information entirely since you don't need credentials for pushing to the internal registry:

.Example of a basic SonataFlowPlatform on Minikube
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform
spec:
  build:
    config:
      strategyOptions:
        KanikoBuildCacheEnabled: "true"
----

[TIP]
====
The `spec.build.config.strategyOptions.KanikoBuildCacheEnabled` enables the internal Kaniko process to cache builder images to try to speed up the building execution.
====
[TIP]
====
The minikube registry addon must be enabled as follows.
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube addons enable registry 
----
To verify that the addon was property enabled:
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube addons list |grep registry
| registry                    | minikube | enabled ✅   | minikube                       |
| registry-aliases            | minikube | disabled     | 3rd party (unknown)            |
| registry-creds              | minikube | disabled     | 3rd party (UPMC Enterprises)   |
----
====

You can save this file locally and run the following command:

.Create a `SonataFlowPlatform`
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f my-sonataflowplatform.yaml -n workflows
----

You can also update "on-the-fly" the `SonataFlowPlatform` registry field with this command (change <YOUR_REGISTRY>)

.Create a `SonataFlowPlatform` with a specific registry
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat my-sonataflowplatform.yaml | sed "s|address: .*|address: <YOUR_REGISTRY>" | kubectl apply -f -
----

[#building-openshift]
== Building on OpenShift

You don't need to do anything to build on OpenShift since the operator will configure everything for you. There are a few customizations you can do described in the <<configure-build-system>> section.

In general, the operator will create a link:{openshift_build_url}[`BuildConfig` to build] the workflow using the mapped xref:cloud/operator/referencing-resource-files.adoc[resource files] and your workflow definition. After the build is finished, the image will be pushed to the internal OpenShift registry backed by an `ImageStream` object.

=== Changing the base builder image

If you are running on OpenShift, you have access to the Red Hat's supported registry. You can change the default builder image by editing the sonataflow-operator-builder-config `ConfigMap`.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc edit cm/sonataflow-operator-builder-config -n {operator_installation_namespace}
----

In your editor, change the first line in the `Dockerfile` entry where it reads `FROM quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-swf-builder-nightly:latest` to the desired image.

This image must be compatible with your operator's installation.

[#build-deploy-workflow]
== Build and deploy your workflow

You can now send your workflow definition (`SonataFlow`) to the operator.

You can find a basic `SonataFlow` bellow:

.Example of the greetings workflow example
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  name: greeting
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/description: Greeting example on k8s!
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  flow:
    start: ChooseOnLanguage
    functions:
      - name: greetFunction
        type: custom
        operation: sysout
    states:
      - name: ChooseOnLanguage
        type: switch
        dataConditions:
          - condition: "${ .language == \"English\" }"
            transition: GreetInEnglish
          - condition: "${ .language == \"Spanish\" }"
            transition: GreetInSpanish
        defaultCondition: GreetInEnglish
      - name: GreetInEnglish
        type: inject
        data:
          greeting: "Hello from JSON Workflow, "
        transition: GreetPerson
      - name: GreetInSpanish
        type: inject
        data:
          greeting: "Saludos desde JSON Workflow, "
        transition: GreetPerson
      - name: GreetPerson
        type: operation
        actions:
          - name: greetAction
            functionRef:
              refName: greetFunction
              arguments:
                message:  ".greeting+.name"
        end: true
----

Save a file in your local file system with this contents named `greetings-workflow.yaml` then run:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f greetings-workflow.yaml -n workflows
----

You can check the logs of the build of your Workflow via:

.Get the Workflow pod logs
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
# on Kubernetes
kubectl logs kogito-greeting-builder -n workflows

# on OpenShift
oc logs buildconfig/greeting -n workflows
----

The final pushed image must be printed into the logs at the end of the build.

== Check if the Workflow is running

In order to check that the {product_name} Greeting is up and running, you can try to perform a test HTTP call, from the greeting Pod.

.Procedure

1. Expose the workflow so you can access it:
+
.Exposing the greeting workflow on Minikube
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
# On Minikube you can use Nodeport
kubectl patch svc greeting -n workflows -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
GREETING_SVC=$(minikube service greeting -n workflows --url)
----
+
.Exposing the greeting workflow on OpenShift
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
# On OpenShift you can expose a route: {openshift_route_new_url}
oc expose svc greeting -n workflows
# get the public URL
GREETING_SVC=$(oc get route/greeting --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----
+
2. Make the HTTP call using `curl`:
+
.Check if the greeting workflow is running
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{"name": "John", "language": "English"}' $GREETING_SVC/greeting
----
+
If everything is working, you should receive a response like this:
+
.Response from the greeting workflow
[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{"id":"b5fbfaa3-b125-4e6c-9311-fe5a3577efdd","workflowdata":{"name":"John","language":"English","greeting":"Hello from JSON Workflow, "}}
----

== Restarting a build

If you require to restart the build for some reason, you can add or edit the annotation `sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true` in the `SonataFlowBuild` instance.

For example:

.Example of a SonataFlowBuild marked to restart
[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowBuild
metadata:
  name: greeting
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true
----

After editing the resource, the operator will start a new build of the workflow. Once this is finished, the workflow will be notified and updated accordingly.

If the build fails, but the workflow has a working deployment, the operator won't rollout a new deployment. 

Ideally you should use this feature if there's a problem with your workflow or the initial build revision.

// TODO: add a troubleshooting guide - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-8864
