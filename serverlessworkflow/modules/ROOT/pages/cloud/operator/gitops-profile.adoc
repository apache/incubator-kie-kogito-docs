This document describes how to use the GitOps profile for deploying {product_name} workflows in production environments.

== Recommended for Production

Using the GitOps profile is recommended for production environments. It provides complete control over workflow image builds, enabling compliance, security, and seamless integration into your existing CI/CD pipelines.

== Workflow Image Structure

The GitOps profile uses container images based on the link:{rh_jdk17_url}[Red Hat OpenJDK 17 UBI 9] runtime. You can review its documentation for detailed information about the image architecture.

The table below highlights important paths in the container image file system.

.Important file system paths
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Path | Description

|`/deployments`
|Application deployment directory containing Quarkus application components

|`/deployments/lib`
|Directory for application libraries

|`/deployments/app`
|Directory for application-specific resources

|`/deployments/quarkus`
|Quarkus-specific configuration files

== Building Workflow Container Images

Below is an example Dockerfile illustrating how to build a container image using the GitOps profile.

.Procedure
. Ensure that your current directory contains the `Dockerfile` and `workflow.sw.yaml` you want to build.
[source,bash]
+
----
ls
# Example Output
workflow.sw.yaml  Dockerfile
----
. Execute the container build, by running following command:
[source,bash]
+
----
docker build -t  your-registry/my-workflow .
----
== Pushing to Container Registry

Push the built container image to your registry:

[source,shell]
----
docker push your-registry/my-workflow:tag
----

== Deploying the Workflow

Configure your SonataFlow Custom Resource to use the built container image:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/profile: gitops
  name: my-workflow
spec:
  flow: # Your workflow as in the *.sw.json or *.sw.yaml file that was used to build the image
  podTemplate:
    container:
      image: your-registry/my-workflow:tag
----

Apply your custom resource to deploy:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f my-workflow.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the `.spec.flow` definition matches the workflow definition used when building the application, as the {product_name} operator matches the flow definition with the provided workflow files during deployment.
