This document describes how to configure Workflow Dev Profile builder image via Platform with the {operator_name}.

== Override Builder image and version

By default the builder image uses a stable version aligned to the {product_name} version.

In the dev mode, you can override the default builder image using the `devBaseImage` in the KogitoServerlessPlatform:

```sh
apiVersion: sw.kogito.kie.org/v1alpha08
kind: KogitoServerlessPlatform
metadata:
  name: kogito-workflow-platform
spec:
  cluster: kubernetes
  devBaseImage:  quay.io/<your_org>/<your-swf-builder>
  platform:
    registry:
      address: quay.io/kiegroup
      secret: regcred
```
