:description: Using persistence in the workflow instance to store its context
:keywords: sonataflow, workflow, serverless, operator, kubernetes, persistence

This document describes how to configure a `SonataFlow` instance to use persistence and store the workflow context in a relational database.

Kubernetes's pods are stateless by definition. In some scenarios, this can be a challenge for workloads that require maintaining the status of 
the application regardless of the pod's lifecycle. In the case of {product_name}, by default, the context of the workflow is lost when the pod restarts.

If your workflow requires recovery from such scenarios, you must provide additional configuration to enable the xref:persistence/core-concepts.adoc#_workflow_runtime_persistence[Workflow Runtime Persistence].
That configuration must be provided by using the <<configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr, `SonataFlowPlatform` CR>> or the <<_configuring_the_persistence_using_the_sonataflow_cr, `SonataFlow` CR>>, and has different scopes depending on each case.

== Configuring the persistence using the SonataFlowPlatform CR

The `SonataFlowPlatform` CR facilitates the configuration of the persistence with namespace scope. It means that it will be automatically applied to all the workflows deployed in
that namespace. This can be useful to reduce the amount resources to configure, for example, in cases where the workflows deployed in that namespace belongs to the same application, etc.
That decision is left to each particular use case, however, it's important to know, that this configuration can be overridden by any workflow in that namespace by using the <<_configuring_the_persistence_using_the_sonataflow_cr, `SonataFlow` CR>>.

Finally, the {operator_name} can also use this configuration to set the xref:cloud/operator/supporting-services.adoc#common-persistence-configuration[supporting service's persistence].

[NOTE]
====
Persistence configurations are applied at workflow deployment time, and potential changes in the SonataFlowPlatform will not impact already deployed workflows.
====

To configure the persistence you must use the `persistence` field in the SonataFlowPlatform CR `spec`:

.SonataFlowPlatform CR persistence configuration example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  persistence:
    postgresql:
      serviceRef:
        name: postgres-example <1>
        namespace: postgres-example-namespace <2>
        databaseName: example-database <3>
        port: 1234 <4>
      secretRef:
        name: postgres-secrets-example <5>
        userKey: POSTGRESQL_USER <6>
        passwordKey: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD <7>
----

<1> Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server.
<2> (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform's` local namespace.
<3> Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the workflow's data.
<4> (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432.
<5> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] containing the username and password to connect with the database.
<6> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the username to connect with the database.
<7> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the password to connect with the database.

This configuration signals the operator that every workflow deployed in the current `SonataFlowPlatform's` namespace must be properly configured to connect with that PostgreSQL database server.
And the operator will add the relevant JDBC connection parameters in the form of environment variables to the workflow container.

Additionally, for `SonataFlow` CR deployments that use the `preview` profile, it will configure the {product_name} build system to include specific Quarkus extensions required for persistence.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, PostgreSQL is the only supported persistence.
====

Below you can see an example of the configurations produced for a workflow with the name `example-workflow`, that was deployed using the previous `SonataFlowPlatform`.
For simplicity, only the `env` configurations related to the persistence has been included. These operator managed configurations are immutable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use the `SonataFlowPlatform` persistence, every workflow is configured to use a PostgreSQL schema name equal to the workflow name.

== Configuring the persistence using the SonataFlow CR

The `SonataFlow` CR facilitates the configuration of the persistence with workflow scope, and you can use it independently if the `SonataFlowPlatform` persistence was already configured in the current namespace, see: <<_persistence_configuration_precedence_rules, Persistence configuration precedence rules>>.

To configure the persistence, you must use the `persistence` field in the `SonataFlow` CR `spec`:

.SonataFlow CR persistence configuration example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  name: example-workflow
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/description: Example Workflow
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  persistence:
    postgresql:
      serviceRef:
        name: postgres-example <1>
        namespace: postgres-example-namespace <2>
        databaseName: example-database <3>
        databaseSchema: example-schema <4>
        port: 1234 <5>
      secretRef:
        name: postgres-secrets-example <6>
        userKey: POSTGRESQL_USER <7>
        passwordKey: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD <8>
  flow:
     ...
----

<1> Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server.
<2> (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the workflow's local namespace.
<3> Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the workflow's data.
<4> (Optional) Name of the database schema to store workflow's data. Defaults to the workflow's name.
<5> (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432.
<6> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] containing the username and password to connect with the database.
<7> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the username to connect with the database.
<8> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the password to connect with the database.


This configuration signals the operator that the current workflow must be properly configured to connect with that PostgreSQL database server when deployed.
Similar to the `SonataFlowPlatform` persistence, the operator will add the relevant JDBC connection parameters in the form of <<persistence_env_vars_config_example, environment variables>> to the workflow container.

Additionally, for `SonataFlow` CR deployments that use the `preview` profile, it can configure the {product_name} build system to include specific Quarkus extensions required for persistence.

To learn how to initialize the database schema see: <<_database_schema_initialization, Database schema initialization>>.

== Persistence configuration precedence rules

<<configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr, `SonataFlow` CR persistence>> can be used with or without the <<configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr, `SonataFlowPlatform` CR persistence>>.

And, if the current namespace has an already configured <<configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr, `SonataFlowPlatform` CR persistence>>, the following rules apply:

* If the `SonataFlow` CR has a configured persistence, that configuration will apply.
* If the `SonataFlow` CR has no configured persistence, i.e., the field `spec.persistence` is not present at all, the persistence configuration will be taken from the current platform.
* If you don't want the current workflow to use `persistence`, you must use the following configuration in the SonataFlow CR: `spec.persistence : {}` to ignore the `SonataFlowPlatform` persistence configuration.

== Persistence configuration and SonataFlow profiles

All the configurations shown for the `SonataFlowPlatform CR` and `SonataFlow CR`, apply exactly the same for both the `preview` and the `gitops` profiles.
However, you must not use them in the `dev` profile, since this profile will simply ignore them.

Finally, the only distinction between `preview` and `gitops` profiles is that, when you use the `gitops` profile, the following Quarkus extensions must be added when you build your workflow image. Since that build is accomplished outside the operator scope.

[cols="40%,40%,20%", options="header"]
|===
|groupId
|artifactId
|version

| {groupId_quarkus-agroal}
| {artifactId_quarkus-agroal}
| {quarkus_version}

| {groupId_quarkus-jdbc-postgresql}
| {artifactId_quarkus-jdbc-postgresql}
| {quarkus_version}

| {groupId_kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc}
| {artifactId_kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc}
| {kogito_version}
|===

If you generate your images by using the `kogito-swf-builder`, you can do it by passing it the following build argument:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS={groupId_quarkus-agroal}:{artifactId_quarkus-agroal}:{quarkus_version},{groupId_quarkus-jdbc-postgresql}:{artifactId_quarkus-jdbc-postgresql}:{quarkus_version},{groupId_kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc}:{artifactId_kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc}:{kogito_version}
----

== Database schema initialization

When you use the `SonataFlow` PostgreSQL persistence, you can either opt to use Flyway to produce the database initialization, or manually upgrade your database via DDL scripts.

=== Flyway managed database initialization

To enable Flyway you must use any of the following configuration procedures:

[NOTE]
====
The Flyway schema initialization is disabled by default.
====

=== Flyway configuration by using the workflow ConfigMap

Add the following property to your workflow ConfigMap.

.Example of enabling Flyway by using the workflow ConfigMap
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: example-workflow
  name: example-workflow-props
data:
  application.properties: |
    quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start = true
----

=== Flyway configuration by using the workflow container env vars

Add the following `env` var in the  `spec.podTemplate.container` of the `SonataFlow` CR.

.Example of enabling Flyway by using the workflow container env vars
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  name: example-workflow
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/description: Example Workflow
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  podTemplate:
    container:
      env:
        - name: QUARKUS_FLYWAY_MIGRATE_AT_START
          value: 'true'
  flow: ...
----

=== Flyway configuration by using SonataFlowPlatForm properties

To apply a common Flyway configuration to all the workflows in a given namespace, you can use the `spec.properties.flow` of the `SonataFlowPlatform` in that namespace.

.Example of enabling Flyway by using the SonataFlowPlatform properties.
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform
spec:
  properties:
       flow:
          - name: quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start
            value: true
----

[NOTE]
====
The configuration above takes effect at workflow deployment time, so you must be sure that the property is configured before you deploy your workflows.
====

=== Manual database initialization by using DDL

To initialize the database schema manually, you must be sure that the following application property `quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start` is not configured, or is set to `false`, and follow this xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/persistence/postgresql-flyway-migration.adoc#manually-executing-scripts[procedure].

[NOTE]
====
Remember that:

* By default, every workflow is configured use a schema name equal to the workflow name, and thus, that manual initialization must be applied for every workflow.
* When you use the <<configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr, `SonataFlow` CR persistence configuration>> it is possible to use the schema name of your choice.
====

== Conclusion
By using the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR you can enable the persistence for all the workflows that you deploy in that namespace.
And, by using the `SonataFlow` CR you can enable the persistence of a particular workflow. If both methods are present in the current namespace, the `SonataFlow` CR configuration has precedence over the `SonataFlowpPlatform` configuration.
