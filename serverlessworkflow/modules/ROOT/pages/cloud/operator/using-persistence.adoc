This document describes how to configure a SonataFlow instance to use persistence to store the flow's context in a relational database.

== Configuring the SonataFlow CR to use persistence

Kubernetes's pods are stateless by definition. In some scenarios, this can be a challenge for workloads that require maintaining the status of 
the application regardless of the pod's lifecycle. In the case of {product_name}, the context of the workflow is lost when the pod restarts.
If your workflow requires recovery from such scenarios, you must to make these additions to your workflow CR:
Use the `persistence` field in the `SonataFlow` workflow spec to define the database service located in the same cluster.
There are 2 ways to accomplish this:

* Using the Platform CR's defined persistence
When the Platform CR is deployed with its persistence spec populated it enables workflows to leverage its configuration to populate the persistence
properties in the workflows. 

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
---
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform
spec:
  persistence:
    postgresql:
      secretRef:
        name: postgres-secrets
        userKey: POSTGRES_USER
        passwordKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      serviceRef:
        name: postgres
        port: 5432
        databaseName: sonataflow
        databaseSchema: shared
  build:
    config:
      strategyOptions:
        KanikoBuildCacheEnabled: "true"
---

The values of `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are the keys in the [Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) that contains the credentials to connect to the postgreSQL instance. 
The SonataFlow Workflow CR 
is defined with its `Persistence` field defined as empty.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  name: callbackstatetimeouts
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/description: Callback State Timeouts Example k8s
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  persistence: {}
  ...
---

This configuration signals the operator that the workflow requires persistence and that it expects its configuration to be populated accordingly. 
The operator will add the relevant JDBC properties in the `application.properties`
generated and as part of the podÂ´s environment so that it can connect to the persistence service defined in the `Platform` CR.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, PostgreSQL is the only persistence supported.

* Using the custom defined persistence in the `SonataFlow` CR

Alternatively, you can define a dedicated configuration in the `SonataFlow` CR instance using the same schema format found in the Platform CRD:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  name: callbackstatetimeouts
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/description: Callback State Timeouts
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  persistence:
    postgresql:
      secretRef:
        name: postgres-secrets
        userKey: POSTGRES_USER
        passwordKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      serviceRef:
        name: postgres
        port: 5432
        databaseName: sonataflow
        databaseSchema: callbackstatetimeouts
  ...
---

Like in the Platform CR case, the values of the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are the secret keys in the secret that contain the credentials to connect to
the PostgreSQL instace.

== Conclusion
You can enable SQL persistence in your workflows by configuring each `SonataFlow` CR instance. And when the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR contains the persistence field configured,
the operator uses this information to configure those `SonataFlow` CRs that request persistence. When both the `Platform CR` and the `SonataFlow CR` contain persistence 
configuration, the operator will use the `Persistence` values from the `SonataFlow` CR.
