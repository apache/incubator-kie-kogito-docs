:description: Configuration of knatve eventing deployed by the operator
:keywords: kogito, sonataflow, workflow, serverless, operator, kubernetes, knative, knative-eventing, events

This document describes how you can configure the workflows to let operator create the Knative eventing resources on Kubernetes.

{operator_name} can analyze the event definitions from the `spec.flow` and create `SinkBinding`/`Trigger` based on the type of the event. Then the workflow service can utilize them for event communications. The same purpose of this feature in quarkus extension can be found xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/event-orchestration/consume-produce-events-with-knative-eventing.adoc#ref-example-sw-event-definition-knative[here].

== Prerequisite
1. Knative is installed on the cluster and Knative Eventing is initiated with a `KnativeEventing` CR.
2. A broker named `default` is created. Currently, all Triggers created by the {operator_name} will read events from `default`

== Configuring the workflow

For the operator to create the `SinkBinding` resources, the workflow must provide the sink information in `spec.sink`.

.Example of a workflow with events
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
--
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
...
spec:
  sink:
    ref: <1>
      name: default
      namespace: greeting
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
  flow:
    events: <2>
      - name: requestQuote
        type: kogito.sw.request.quote
        kind: produced
      - name: aggregatedQuotesResponse,
        type: kogito.loanbroker.aggregated.quotes.response,
        kind: consumed,
        source: /kogito/serverless/loanbroker/aggregator
...
--
<1> `spec.sink.ref` defines the sink that all created sinkBinding will use as the destination sink for producing events
<2> `spec.flow.events` lists all the events referenced in the workflow. Events with `produced` kind will trigger the creation of `SinkBindings` by the {operator_name}, while those labeled as `consumed` will lead to the generation of `Triggers`.

[NOTE]
====
Knative resources are not watched by the operator, indicating they will not undergo automatic reconciliation. This grants users the freedom to make updates at their preference.
