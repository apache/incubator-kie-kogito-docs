This document describes how to configure and deploy the {product_name}'s xref:data-index/data-index-core-concepts.adoc[Data Index] and xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc[Job Service] supporting services, using the {operator_name}.

In general, in a regular {product_name} installation you must deploy both services to ensure a successful execution of your workflows. To get more information about each service please read the respective guides.

.Prerequisites
* The {operator_name} installed. See xref:cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.adoc[] guide.
* A PostgreSQL database service instance. Required if you are planning to use the <<postgresql-persistence-configuration>> for a supporting service.

[#supporting-services-workflow-communications]
== Supporting Services and Workflow communications

When you deploy a supporting service in a given namespace, you can do it by using an <<enabled-deployment-field, enabled or disabled>> deployment.

An enabled deployment, signals the {operator_name} to automatically intercept every workflow deployment with the `preview` or `gitops` profile, in this namespace, and automatically configure it to connect with that service.

For example, if the Data Index is enabled, a workflow will be automatically configured to send workflow status change events to it.
And, similar configurations are produced if the Job Service is enabled, to create a Job, every time a workflow requires a timeout.
Additionally, the operator will configure the Job Service to send events to the Data Index Service, etc.

As you can see, the operator can not only deploy a supporting service, but also, manage other configurations to ensure the successful execution of a workflow.

Fortunately, all these configurations are managed automatically, and you must only provide the supporting services configuration in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.

[NOTE]
====
Scenarios where you only deploy one of the supporting services, or configure a disabled deployment, are intended for advanced use cases.
In a regular installation, you must normally configure an enabled deployment of both services to ensure a successful execution of your workflows.
====

[#deploy-supporting-services]
== Deploying the supporting services using the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR

To deploy the supporting services you must use the sub-fields `dataIndex` and `jobService` in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR `spec.services`.
That information signals the {operator_name} to deploy each service when the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR is deployed.

[NOTE]
====
Each service configuration is considered independently, and you can combine these configurations with any other configuration present in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.
====

The following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR fragment shows a scaffold configuration that you can use as reference:
[#supporting-services-configuration]
.Supporting services configuration
[source,yam]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  services:
    dataIndex: <1>
      enabled: true <2>
      # Specific configurations for the Data Index Service
      # might be included here
    jobService: <3>
      enabled: true <4>
      # Specific configurations for the Job Service
      # might be included here
----
[#enabled-deployment-field]
<1> Data Index Service configuration field.
<2> If true, produces an enabled Data Index Service deployment, <<supporting-services-workflow-communications, see>>. Other cases produce a disabled deployment. The default is `false`.
<3> Job Service configuration field.
<4>  If true, produces an enabled Job Service deployment, <<supporting-services-workflow-communications, see>>. Other cases produce a disabled deployment. The default is `false`.

[NOTE]
====
The configuration above produces an ephemeral deployment of each service, <<ephemeral-persistence-configuration, see>>.
====

== Supporting Services Scope

The `SonataFlowPlatform` CR facilitates the deployment of the supporting services with namespace scope.
It means that, all the automatically configured <<supporting-services-workflow-communications>>, are restricted to the namespace of the given platform.
This can be useful, in cases where you need separate supporting service instances for a set of workflows.
For example, a given application can be deployed isolated with its workflows, and the supporting services.

Additionally, using the `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` CR it's possible to configure a <<cluster-scoped-deployment, cluster scoped deployment>> of the supporting services.

== Configuring the Supporting Services Persistence

[#ephemeral-persistence-configuration]
=== Ephemeral persistence configuration

The ephemeral persistence of a service is supported by an embedded PostgreSQL database dedicated to it. That database, is re-created by the operator on every service restart.
And thus, it's only recommended for development and testing purposes.

The ephemeral deployment of a service requires no additional configurations than the shown, <<supporting-services-configuration, here>>.

[#postgresql-persistence-configuration]
=== PostgreSQL persistence configuration

The PosgreSQL persistence of a service is supported by a PostgreSQL server instance, that you must previously install on the cluster.
The administration of that instance is totally independent of the {operator_name} scope, and to connect a supporting service with it, you must only configure the correct database connection parameters.

The following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR fragment shows the configuration options that you must use:

.PostgreSQL persistence configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  services:
    dataIndex:
      enabled: true
      persistence:
        postgresql:
          serviceRef:
            name: postgres-example <1>
            namespace: postgres-example-namespace <2>
            databaseName: example-database <3>
            databaseSchema: data-index-schema <4>
            port: 1234 <5>
          secretRef:
            name: postgres-secrets-example <6>
            userKey: POSTGRESQL_USER <7>
            passwordKey: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD <8>
    jobService:
      enabled: true
      persistence:
        postgresql:
        # Specific database configuration for the Job Service
        # might be included here.
----

<1> Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server.
<2> (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform's` local namespace.
<3> Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the supporting service data.
<4> (Optional) Name of the PostgreSQL database schema to store the supporting service data.
Defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform's` `name`, suffixed with `-data-index-service` or `-jobs-service`. For example, `sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service`.
<5> (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432.
<6> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] containing the username and password to connect with the database.
<7> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the username to connect with the database.
<8> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the password to connect with the database.

[NOTE]
====
The persistence of each service can be configured independently by using the respective `persistence` field.
====

To create the secrets for the example above you can use a command like this:

.Create secret example
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic postgres-secrets-example  --from-literal=POSTGRESQL_USER=<user> --from-literal=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<password> -n postgres-example-namespace
----


[#common-persistence-configuration]
=== Common PostgreSQL persistence configuration

To configure a common PostgreSQL service instance for all the supporting services you must read, xref:cloud/operator/using-persistence.adoc#configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr[Configuring the persistence using the SonataFlowPlatform CR].

In that case, the {operator_name} will automatically connect any of the supporting services with that common server configured in the field `spec.persistence`. And, similarly to the workflow's persistence, the following precedence rules apply:

* If a supporting service has a configured persistence, for example, the field `services.dataIndex.persistence` is configured. That configuration will apply.

* If a supporting service has no configured persistence, for example, the field `services.dataIndex.persistence` is not set at all, the persistence configuration will be taken from the current platform.


[NOTE]
====
When you use the common PostgreSQL configuration, the database schema for each supporting service is automatically configured as the SonataFlowPlatformâ€™s `name`, suffixed with `-data-index-service` or `-jobs-service` respectively.
For example, `sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service`.
====

== Advanced Supporting Services Configurations

To configure the advanced options for any of the supporting services you must use the `podTemplate` field respectively, for example `dataIndex.podTemplate`:

.Advanced configurations example for the Data Index Service.
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  services:
    dataIndex:
      enabled: true
      podTemplate:
        replicas: 2 <1>
        container: <2>
          env: <3>
            - name: ANY_ADVANCED_CONFIG_PROPERTY
              value: any-value
          image: <4>
        initContainers: <5>
----

<1> Number of replicas. Defaults to 1. In the case of the jobService this value is always overridden to 1 by the operator, since that service is a singleton service.
<2> Holds the particular configurations for the container that will execute the given supporting service.
<3> Standard Kubernetes `env` configuration. This can be useful in cases where you need to fine tune any of the supporting services properties.
<4> Standard Kubernetes `image` configuration. This can be useful in cases where you need to use an updated image for any of the supporting services.
<5> Standard Kubernetes `initContainers` for the Pod that executes the supporting service.

[NOTE]
====
The `podTemplate` field of any supporting service has the majority of fields defined in the default Kubernetes PodSpec API.
The same Kubernetes API validation rules apply to these fields.
====

[#cluster-scoped-deployment]
== Cluster Scoped Supporting Services

The `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` CR is optionally used to specify a cluster-wide set of supporting services for workflow consumption.
This is done by referencing an existing, namespaced `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.

Following is a basic configuration that allows workflows, deployed in any namespace, to leverage supporting services deployed in the chosen `example-namespace` namespace.

.Example of a SonataFlowClusterPlatform CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowClusterPlatform
metadata:
  name: cluster-platform
spec:
  platformRef:
    name: sonataflow-platform-example <1>
    namespace: example-namespace <2>
----

<1> Name of the already installed `SonatataFlowPlatform` CR that configures the supporting services.
<2> Namespace of the already installed `SontataFlowPlatform` CR that configures the supporting services.

[NOTE]
====
These cluster-wide services can be overridden in any namespace, by configuring that namespace's `SonataFlowPlatform.spec.services`.
====

== Conclusions

The {operator_name} extends its scope to manage the lifecycle of the xref:data-index/data-index-core-concepts.adoc[Data Index] and xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc[Job Service] instances, thus removing the burden on the users and allowing them to focus on the implementation of the workflows.
It takes care also of managing all the configurations to facilitate communication between the workflows and the supporting services.
Additionally, it can manage different persistence options for each service, and advanced configurations.
