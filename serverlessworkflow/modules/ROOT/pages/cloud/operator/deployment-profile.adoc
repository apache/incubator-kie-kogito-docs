:description: Overview of deployment profiles for SonataFlow workflows
:keywords: sonataflow, workflow, serverless, operator, kubernetes, gitops, devmode, preview

This document introduces the three deployment profiles supported by the {product_name} Operator—`dev`, `preview`, and `gitops`. These profiles influence how the operator builds and manages workflow deployments, especially regarding image lifecycle, live updates, and reconciliation behavior.

[NOTE]
====
Deployment *profiles* define how the workflow is built and managed by the operator.

If you're looking to customize how the workflow is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment or a Knative Service, see xref:cloud/operator/customize-podspec.adoc#deployment-model[Deployment Model].
====

[#gitops-profile]
== GitOps Profile

The `gitops` profile provides full control over workflow images. In this model, you build your workflow container externally (e.g., CI/CD pipeline) and specify the image in the SonataFlow custom resource:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    container:
      image: quay.io/acme/myworkflow:latest
----

When this field is set, the operator automatically assumes the `gitops` profile and will not build or mutate the image.

Use this profile when:

* You want full control over the build process
* You need to satisfy production requirements like auditability, security, and compliance
* You're integrating SonataFlow into existing GitOps-based workflows (e.g., ArgoCD, Tekton)

xref:cloud/operator/gitops-profile.adoc[Read more about the GitOps Profile].

[#preview-profile]
== Preview Profile

The `preview` profile lets the operator handle workflow builds using an internal build pipeline. Any changes to the `.spec.flow` will trigger a rebuild and a new immutable container image.

This profile is ideal for:

* Pre-production staging and demonstration environments
* Quick validation of workflow logic without managing the build pipeline

Key characteristics:

* The operator uses `application-prod.properties`
* Images are automatically built and managed
* Supports setting `deploymentModel: knative` (see xref:cloud/operator/customize-podspec.adoc#deployment-model[Deployment Models])

[#dev-profile]
== Development Profile

The `dev` profile supports rapid iteration and live updates directly from the cluster. Changes to the custom resource take effect almost immediately without triggering a new container image build.

This profile is ideal for:

* Live development and testing of workflows
* Quick iterations without a build process
* Extending workflows using the base developer image

Key characteristics:

* Uses `application-dev.properties`
* Automatically reloads the flow without rebuilding the container
* The image must be based on `{sonataflow_devmode_imagename}:{operator_version}`

[#choosing-profile]
== Choosing the Right Profile

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Use Case |Profile

|Full control of build and deployment
|`gitops`

|Internal automated build and deploy
|`preview`

|Fast iteration during development
|`dev`
|===


== Switching Between Profiles

To select a deployment profile, annotate your SonataFlow custom resource:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/profile: preview
----

Valid values: `dev`, `preview`, `gitops`.

NOTE: Setting `.spec.podTemplate.container.image` will override this annotation and automatically activate the `gitops` profile.

== Profile Implications for Customization

Your selected profile impacts how the operator treats certain configuration aspects:

[cols="1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Profile |Image Build |Reconciliation |`.spec.resources` |Supports Knative

|`dev`
|Live reload
|Auto-updates
|Mounted in dev volume
|❌ Ignored

|`preview`
|Internal build
|Rebuilt on change
|Used during build
|✅

|`gitops`
|User-supplied
|No rebuild
|Ignored
|✅
|===


[NOTE]
====
For pod-level customization, including using `initContainers`, setting resource limits, and configuring deployment model (`knative` vs. `kubernetes`), see xref:cloud/operator/customize-podspec.adoc[].
