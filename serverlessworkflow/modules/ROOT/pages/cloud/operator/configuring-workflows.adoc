This document describes how to configure a Workflow service with the {operator_name}.

== Editing the Workflow Configuration

When the operator deploys the Workflow service, it also creates a `ConfigMap` named after the `SonataFlow` object with the suffix `-props`. For example, if your Workflow name is `greeting`, then the `ConfigMap` name is `greeting-props`.

You can use the Kubernetes object editor of your preference to add or edit the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties[properties] in the Workflow configuration. Using `kubectl` you can do:

.Editing the Workflow Properties
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl edit cm <workflow-name>-props
----

Note that it's important to respect the properties format, otherwise the operator will replace your configuration with the default one.

Here's an example of a Workflow properties stored within a ConfigMap:

.Example of a Workflow ConfigMap Properties
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: greeting
  name: greeting-props
  namespace: default
data:
  application.properties: |
    my.properties.key = any-value
----

The underlying runtime engine that executes the Workflow service is based on link:{quarkus_url}[Quarkus]. The `application.properties` key in the ConfigMap means that you can configure the Workflow as you would any link:{quarkus_config_url}[Quarkus application].

Any xref:core/configuration-properties.adoc[{product_name} configuration that the documentation describes] or general Quarkus application property can be configured using this method.

== Immutable properties

A few properties cannot be changed in this configuration. Usually, they are already defined in the properties file. The table below lists them.

.List of immutable properties
[cols="2,1,1"]
|===
|Property Key | Immutable Value | Profile

|quarkus.http.port
|8080
|all

|quarkus.http.host
|0.0.0.0
|all

|org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.health-enabled
|false
|dev

|===

If you try to change any of them, the operator will override them with the default, but preserving your changes in other property keys.
