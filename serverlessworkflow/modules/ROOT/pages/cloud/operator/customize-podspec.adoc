This document describes how to customize the pod specification (`PodSpec`) in a SonataFlow custom resource to meet runtime requirements in Kubernetes and OpenShift, such as adding volumes, setting resource limits, or using a custom container image.

If you're looking to understand how the operator builds and manages workflow lifecycles (e.g., live updates or immutable builds), refer to xref:cloud/operator/deployment-profile.adoc[Deployment Profiles].

== Overview

The `.spec.podTemplate` attribute allows you to define a custom link:{k8s_podspec_api_url}[PodSpec] for the deployed workflow instance. This enables fine-grained control over how the workflow runs inside the container.

Use `.spec.podTemplate.container` to customize the default workflow container (named `workflow`). This field is not part of the standard PodSpec, but was introduced by the operator to simplify configuration.

== Example: Setting Resource Limits

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    container:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "250m"
          memory: "128Mi"
----

== Customizing the Workflow Container

You can customize the workflow container via `.spec.podTemplate.container` with fields like:

- `resources`
- `image`
- `env`
- `command` and `args`

Avoid using the main `containers` array to redefine the `workflow` container â€” the operator will ignore conflicting names.

== Adding Additional Containers and Volumes

You may add:

- `containers` (sidecars)
- `initContainers`
- `volumes`
- `volumeMounts` (on sidecars or initContainers)

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot override volumes or mount paths controlled by the operator. See <<customization-exceptions>>.
====

[[deployment-model]]
== Deployment Model

By default, the SonataFlow Operator deploys workflow instances using a standard Kubernetes `Deployment`. You can opt into using a serverless model via Knative Serving.

To enable Knative deployment:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    deploymentModel: knative <1>
----

<1> Valid values: `kubernetes` (default), `knative`

After enabling this option, the workflow will be deployed as a Knative `Service`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `deploymentModel: knative` is only honored in the `preview` and `gitops` profiles. It is ignored when using the `dev` profile.
====

Use Knative when:
- You need scale-to-zero or autoscaling based on HTTP traffic.
- The workflow is short-lived or event-driven.
- You have persistence enabled for workflows with callbacks or long waits.

See: 
- xref:cloud/operator/deployment-profile.adoc[Deployment Profiles]
- xref:cloud/operator/using-persistence.adoc[]
- link:{knative_serving_initcontainer}[Knative InitContainer support]

[#customization-exceptions]
== Customization Exceptions

Some paths and volumes are managed by the operator and **must not be overridden**:

[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
|Volume | Type | Path | Profile

| workflow-properties
| `ConfigMap`
| `/deployments/config/application.properties`, `/deployments/config/application-prod.properties`
| preview

| workflow-properties
| `ConfigMap`
| `$\{PROJECT_ROOT\}/src/main/resources/application.properties`, `application-dev.properties`
| dev

| resources
| `Projected`
| `$\{PROJECT_ROOT\}/src/main/resources/`
| dev

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the `dev` profile, all `.spec.resources` are mounted in the `resources` projected volume. Avoid mounting anything else at that path.
====

== Using a Custom Image

You may override the workflow container image using:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    container:
      image: quay.io/myorg/myworkflow:latest
----

When this is set, the operator assumes you're using the **gitops** deployment profile and won't attempt to build or update the image automatically.

For more information, see xref:cloud/operator/deployment-profile.adoc#custom-image-default-container[].
