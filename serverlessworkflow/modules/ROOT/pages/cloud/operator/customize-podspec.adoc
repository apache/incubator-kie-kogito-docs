This document describes how to customize the pod specification definition in thew `SonataFlow` custom resource.

Sometimes you may have a specific requirement to deploy containers on Kubernetes or OpenShift such as setting link:{k8s_resources_limits_url}[Resource Limits].

{operator_name} enables custom link:{k8s_podspec_api_url}[PodSpec] definitions when deploying a `SonataFlow` instance by setting the `.spec.podTemplate` attribute. For example:

    start: HelloWorld
    states:

        end: true

<1> The `PodSpec` template definition
<2> The default workflow service container 
<3> Resources configuration

The `.spec.podTemplate` attribute has the majority of fields defined in the default link:{k8s_podspec_api_url}[Kubernetes PodSpec API]. The same Kubernetes API validation rules applies to these fields.

The `.spec.podTemplate.container` is a special attribute that you won't find in the default Kubernetes API. The reason is to avoid misconfiguration when users require to change the specific container where the workflow application is deployed.

== Customization Exceptions

Besides customizing the default container, you can add more `containers`, `initContainers`, or `volumes` to the pod. There are a few exceptions listed below:

1. The `containers` array can't have a container named `workflow`. If you set a container with this name, it will be ignored by the operator. Instead, use `.spec.podTemplate.container` to modify the workflow container.
2. There are a few file system paths controlled by the operator within the container where it mounts important files. These volumes can't be overrided, it will be ignored by the operatror. See the table below:

[#operator-profiles]
== About {operator_name} Profiles

Profiles are a way to change the runtime and deployment behavior of workflows. You can change the `SonataFlow` custom resource profile using `annotations`. For example:

.Example of a SonataFlow CR with a profile annotation
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  name: simple
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/profile: preview <1>
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  flow:
    start: HelloWorld
    states:
      - name: HelloWorld
        type: inject
        data:
          message: Hello World
        end: true

<1> Preview profile defined in the `sonataflow.org/profile` annotation. This is the default profile.

The {operator_name} supports three different profiles:

1. `dev`: The workflow will be deployed as a mutable container that will react upon any changes on the `SonataFlow` custom resource immediatelly. Ideal for scenarios where the flow definition is under active development and testing in the cluster context. See xref:cloud/operator/developing-workflows.adoc[].
2. `preview`: The operator will rely on an internal build system to build an immutable container based on the flow definition. Every change to the `SonataFlow` will kick a new build. Use this profile to evaluate the workflow behavior in the cluster or if you have a simple use case where you don't need any complex build customizations. See xref:cloud/operator/build-and-deploy-workflows.adoc[]
// TODO: missing tekton/argocd guide https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-7278
3. `gitops`: Ideal for production use cases. This profile is automatically defined by the operator when the `SonataFlow` CR is deployed with a custom `.spec.podTemplate.container.image`. In this scenario, the user is responsible to build the workflow application and provide the image to the operator. 

There's a correlation on the operator profile and the internal runtime workflow Quarkus application. See the table below.

.Correlation of the operator and Quarkus profiles
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Operator Profile | Quarkus Profile | Description

| dev
| dev
| Suitable for testing only. The configuration file managed by the operator is `application-dev.properties`

| preview
| prod
| Suitable for quick evaluation and use of the internal builder system. The configuration file managed by the operator is `application-prod.properties`

| gitops
| prod
| Workflow image externally built by another system. The configuration file managed by the operator is `application-prod.properties`

[#custom-image-default-container]
=== Setting a custom image in the default container

When setting the attribute `.spec.podTemplate.container.image` the operator understands that the workflow already have an image built and the user is responsible for the build and image maintainence. That means that the operator won't try to upgrade this image in the future or do any reconciliation changes to it.

=== Setting a custom image in devmode

In xref:cloud/operator/developing-workflows.adoc[development profile], it's expected that the image is based on the default `quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-swf-devmode:latest`. 

=== Setting a custom image in preview

When xref:cloud/operator/build-and-deploy-workflows.adoc[building workflows], you can opt in to have the operator to handle the build process for you. However, in more complex scenarios it's expected that the user owns and controls the build process. For this reason, when overriding the image the operator won't build the workflow. The operator will try to deploy the workflow using the given image. 

In this scenario, the `.spec.resources` attribute is ignored since it's only used during the build process in the production profile. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
xref:cloud/operator/known-issues.adoc[In the roadmap] you will find that we plan to consider the `.spec.resources` attribute when the image is specified in the default container.
====

It's advised that the SonataFlow `.spec.flow` definition and the workflow built within the image corresponds to the same workflow. If these definitions don't match you may experience poorly management and configuration. The {operator_name} uses the `.spec.flow` attribute to configure the application, service discovery, and service binding with other deployments within the topology.

[IMPORTANT]
====
xref:cloud/operator/known-issues.adoc[It's on the roadmap] to add integrity check to the built images provided to the operator by customizing the default container.
