:keywords: kogito, workflow, serverless, operator, kubernetes, minikube, openshift, containers

This guide describes how to install the {operator_name} in a Kubernetes cluster. The operator is in an xref:/cloud/operator/known-issues.adoc[early development stage] (community only) and has been tested on Kubernetes 1.22+, and link:{minikube_url}[Minikube].

.Prerequisites
* A Kubernetes cluster with admin privileges. Alternatively, you can use Minikube or KIND.
* `kubectl` command-line tool is installed. Otherwise, Minikube provides it.

== Prepare a Minikube instance

[WARNING]
====
You can safely skip this section if you're not using Minikube.
====

.Prerequisites
* A machine with at least 8GB memory and a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor[CPU with 8 cores]
* Docker or Podman installed

Run the following command to create a new instance capable of installing the operator and deploy workflows:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons registry --addons metrics-server --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24" --insecure-registry "localhost:5000"
----

[NOTE]
====
To speed up the build time, you can increase CPUs and memory options so that your minikube instance will have more resources. For example, use `--cpus 12 --memory 16384`. In order to work, you will have to recreate your instance.
====

If it does not work with the default driver, also known as `docker`, you can try to start with the `podman` driver as follows:

.Start minikube with podman driver
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube start [...] --driver podman
----

== Install the {product_name} Operator

In order to have an up-and-running instance of the {product_name} Operator you can use the following command:

// TODO: replace this URI with the GitHub's artifact release instead.
.Install {product_name} Operator on Kubernetes
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/{operator_version}/operator.yaml
----

You can follow the deployment of the {product_name} Operator:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get pod -n kogito-serverless-operator-system --watch
----

A successful installation should have an output like this:

.Successful Installation Output
[source]
----
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2   0/2     ContainerCreating   0          6s
kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2   1/2     Running             0          7s
kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2   2/2     Running             0          20s
----

You can also follow the operatorâ€™s log:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod logs
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl logs deployment/kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager -n kogito-serverless-operator-system -f
----

Once the operator is running, it will watch for new custom resources (CR) so that you can prepare your environment to be ready to create a new {product_name} application based on the definitions you will send to the operator.

To check if the definitions are correclty installed, try running:

.Check if the CRDs are correctly installed
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get crds | grep kogito
kogitoserverlessbuilds.sw.kogito.kie.org      2023-03-08T18:31:15Z
kogitoserverlessplatforms.sw.kogito.kie.org   2023-03-08T18:31:15Z
kogitoserverlessworkflows.sw.kogito.kie.org   2023-03-08T18:31:15Z
----

== Uninstall the Operator
// TODO: this is super verbose for now because we don't have OLM/OperatorHub. This procedure should be replaced as soon as we have them. Or it should be renamed to "Uninstalling snapshot/local versions", so crazy users that don't rely on operatorhub/olm can also install/uninstall their instances.

To uninstall the {operator_name}, first you should remove all the object instances managed by it. Then, you can delete every object created during the installation.

To delete every object instance managed by the workflow in your cluster, you can run these series of commands:

.Delete every {product_name} object instances
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl delete --all workflow --all-namespaces
kubectl delete --all kogitoserverlessbuild --all-namespaces
kubectl delete --all kogitoserverlessplatform --all-namespaces
----

Alternatively, if you created everything under the same namespace, deleting the given namespace has the same outcome.

To uninstall the correct version of the operator, first you must get the current version by running:

.Getting the operator version
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get deployment kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager -n kogito-serverless-operator-system -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=='manager')].image}"

quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator-nightly:1.34.0
----

The operator manager image reflects the current operator's version. Replace the major and minor version names in the command below. For example, if the image version is `1.34.0` use `1.34` in the placeholder:

.Uninstalling the operator
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/<version>.x/operator.yaml
----

[TIP]
====
If you're running a snapshot version, use this URL instead `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/main/operator.yaml`.
