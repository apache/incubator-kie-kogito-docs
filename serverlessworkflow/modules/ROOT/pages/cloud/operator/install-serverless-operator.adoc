This guide describes how to install the {operator_name} in a Kubernetes cluster. The operator is in an xref:/cloud/operator/known-issues.adoc[early development stage] (community only) and has been tested on Kubernetes 1.22+, and link:{minikube_url}[Minikube].

.Prerequisites
* A Kubernetes cluster with admin privileges. Alternatively, you can use Minikube or KIND.
* `kubectl` command-line tool is installed. Otherwise, Minikube provides it.

== Prepare a Minikube Instance

[WARNING]
====
You can safely skip this section if you're not using Minikube.
====

.Prerequisites
* A machine with at least 8GB memory and a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor[CPU with 8 cores]
* Docker or Podman installed

Run the following command to create a new instance capable of installing the operator and deploy workflows:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons registry --addons metrics-server --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24" --insecure-registry "localhost:5000"
----

[NOTE]
====
To speed up the build time, you can increase the CPUs and memory options so that your Minikube instance will have more resources. For example, use `--cpus 12 --memory 16384`. If you have already created your Minikube instance, you will need to recreate it for these changes to apply.
====

If Minikube does not work with the default driver, also known as `docker`, you can try to start with the `podman` driver as follows:

.Start Minikube with the Podman driver
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube start [...] --driver podman
----

== Install the {product_name} Operator

To install the {product_name} Operator, you can use the following command:

// TODO: replace this URI with the GitHub's artifact release instead.
.Install {product_name} Operator on Kubernetes
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/{operator_version}/operator.yaml
----

You can follow the deployment of the {product_name} Operator:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get pod -n kogito-serverless-operator-system --watch
----

A successful installation should have an output like this:

.Successful Installation Output
[source]
----
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2   0/2     ContainerCreating   0          6s
kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2   1/2     Running             0          7s
kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2   2/2     Running             0          20s
----

You can also follow the operatorâ€™s log:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod logs
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl logs deployment/kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager -n kogito-serverless-operator-system -f
----

Once the operator is running, it will watch for instances of the {product_name} Custom Resources (CR). Using CRs, you can configure your {product_name} environment and define Workflows and builds to be handled by the operator.

For the operator to correctly manage the CR instances, you must first install the {product_name} Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). To check if the CRDs are correctly installed, try running:

.Check if the CRDs are correctly installed
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get crds | grep kogito
sonataflowbuilds.sonataflow.org      2023-03-08T18:31:15Z
sonataflowplatforms.sonataflow.org   2023-03-08T18:31:15Z
sonataflows.sonataflow.org   2023-03-08T18:31:15Z

== Uninstall the Operator
// TODO: this is super verbose for now because we don't have OLM/OperatorHub. This procedure should be replaced as soon as we have them. Or it should be renamed to "Uninstalling snapshot/local versions", so crazy users that don't rely on operatorhub/olm can also install/uninstall their instances.

To uninstall the {operator_name}, first, you must delete all the {product_name} Custom Resources (CR) instances managed by it. Once the CRs are deleted, you can then delete all resources created during the operator installation.

To delete every CR managed by the operator in your cluster, you can run these series of commands:

.Delete all {product_name} CR instances
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl delete --all workflow --all-namespaces
kubectl delete --all sonataflowbuild --all-namespaces
kubectl delete --all sonataflowplatform --all-namespaces
----

Alternatively, if you created everything under the same Namespace, deleting the given namespace has the same outcome.

To uninstall the correct version of the operator, first you must get the current version by running:

.Getting the operator version
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get deployment kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager -n kogito-serverless-operator-system -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=='manager')].image}"

quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator-nightly:1.34.0
----

The operator manager image reflects the current operator's version. Replace the major and minor version names in the command below. For example, if the image version is `1.34.0` use `1.34` in the placeholder:

.Uninstalling the operator
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/<version>.x/operator.yaml
----

[TIP]
====
If you're running a snapshot version, use this URL instead `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/main/operator.yaml`.
