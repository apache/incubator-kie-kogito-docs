This document describes link:{spec_doc_url}#Event-State[event state] in a workflow. You can use the event state to start a new workflow instance upon the reception of a designated link:{cloud_events_url}[CloudEvent] or to pause the execution of an existing workflow instance until a designated CloudEvent is received.

[[ref-example-event-match]]
== Example of event match

An event state consists of one or more link:{spec_doc_url}#event-definition[event definitions]. Event definitions are combined to designate the CloudEvent types that the event state listens to.

In an event definition, the `onEvents` property is used to group the CloudEvent types that might trigger the same set of `actions`. The `exclusive` property in an event definition indicates how an event match is calculated. In case the value of `exclusive` property is `false`, then all CloudEvent types in the `eventRefs` array must be received for a match to occur. Otherwise, the reception of the referenced CloudEvent types is considered a match.

The following is an example of event definitions, consisting of two CloudEvent types including `noisy` and `silent`:

.Example event definitions
[source, json]
----
"events": [
    {
      "name": "noisyEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "noisy",
      "dataOnly" : "false"
    },
    {
      "name": "silentEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "silent"
    }
  ]
----

To indicate that an event match occurs when both `noisy` and `silent` CloudEvent types are received and to execute different actions for both CloudEvent types, define an event state containing both event definitions in separate `onEvent` items and set `exclusive` property to `false`.

.Example event state defintion with multiple `onEvent` items
[source, json]
----
  {
    "name": "waitForEvent",
    "type": "event",
    "onEvents": [
      {
        "eventRefs": [
          "noisyEvent"
         ],
         "actions": [ 
           {
             "functionRef": "letsGetLoud"
           }
         ]
      },
      {
        "eventRefs": [
           "silentEvent"
        ],
        "actions": [ 
          {
            "functionRef": "beQuiet"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    , 
    "exclusive": false
  }
----

To execute the same action when both event types are received, use only one `onEvent` item as shown in the following example:

.Example event state definition with single `onEvent` item
[source, json]
----
  {
    "name": "waitForEvent",
    "type": "event",
    "onEvents": [
      {
        "eventRefs": [
          "noisyEvent",
          "silentEvent"
         ],
         "actions": [ 
           {
             "functionRef": "notCareAboutNoise"
           }
         ]
       }
    ]
    ,
    "exclusive": false
  }
----

If you want the same action to be executed when any of the event types is received, set the `exclusive` property to `true` as shown in the following example:

.Example event state definition executing same action
[source, json]
----
  {
    "name": "waitForEvent",
    "type": "event",
    "onEvents": [
      {
        "eventRefs": [
          "noisyEvent",
          "silentEvent"
         ],
         "actions": [ 
           {
             "functionRef": "notCareAboutNoise"
           }
         ]
       }
    ]
    ,"exclusive": true
  }
----

You can also remove the `exclusive` property, as `true` is the default value.

To start a new workflow instance, set the `start` property to the event state name in the workflow header. The workflow instance starts when there is an event match. Using the previous example of event state definition, add the following code in the workflow header:

.Start a workflow instance
[source,json]
----
"start":"waitForEvent"
----

An event state can also be used to pause an existing workflow instance. When the workflow execution reaches an event state, which is not starting, then the execution is paused until there is an event match for that workflow instance.

Similar to the callback state in a workflow, the workflow instance to be resumed is identified by `kogitoprocrefid` CloudEvent attribute or calculated according to the xref:eventing/event-correlation-with-workflows.adoc[event correlation] functionality. While callback state is used for _fire&wait_ scenarios, event state covers _wait&fire_ scenarios. For more information about the callback state, see xref:eventing/working-with-callbacks.adoc[Callback state in {product_name}].
