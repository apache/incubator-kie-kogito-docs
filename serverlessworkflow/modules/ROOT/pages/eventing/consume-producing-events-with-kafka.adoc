This document describes how you can configure a workflow to interact with link:{kafka_doc_url}[Apache Kafka]. Apache Kafka uses an abstraction called topic to classify events. Events are published to a topic, and events are consumed from a topic. 

{product_name} uses link:{smallrye_connector_doc_url}[Smallrye connectors] to encapsulate access to several brokers, enabling {product_name} to support different brokers by changing the configuration and classpath dependencies. However, Smallrye connectors also introduce an entity called channel. The Smallrye channels are unidirectional and need to be declared as input (`incoming`) or output (`outgoing`). When using Apache Kafka, the Smallrye channels must be mapped to Apache Kafka topics through configuration.

You need to add the Kafka Quarkus Smallrye connector dependency to indicate that you are using Apache Kafka. To enable a workflow to use Apache Kafka Smallrye connector, add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file of your project if using Apache Maven:

.Add dependency for Apache Kafka Smallrye connector in `pom.xml`
[source,json]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The messaging capabilities are included in the Quarkus Serverless Workflow extension, even though the messaging capabilities are optional. This means you do not need to explicitly add the messaging add-on dependency when using {product_name}.

[[con-sw-smallrye-channel-configuration]]
== Smallrye channels configuration for a workflow

You can configure Smallrye channels for a workflow using event definitions. The Smallrye channels are defined using link:{quarkus_config_url}[Quarkus configuration]. The format for Smallrye channel properties is `mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing].<channel name>.<property_name>`. 

{product_name} allows the following channel mapping strategies:

* Define one default incoming channel to receive all the incoming messages and one default outgoing channel to store all the published messages.
* Define a channel for each link:{cloud_events_url}[CloudEvent] type so that every message type has a dedicated channel.
* Define a channel for certain CloudEvent types. The non-mapped CloudEvent types uses the default incoming or outgoing channel.

{product_name} first searches for a channel name in the properties that is same as CloudEvent type. If the channel name is found, {product_name} uses the channel for that CloudEvent type. However, if the channel name is not found, {product_name} searches for the default channel definition. In case the default channel definition is not existing, then an error is reported. 

The default incoming channel is `kogito_incoming_stream` and the default outgoing channel is `kogito_outgoing_stream`.

To change the default incoming and outgoing topic names, you can use the following properties:

.Properties to change default incoming and outgoing topic names
[source,properties]
----
kogito.addon.messaging.incoming.defaultName=<default channel name>
kogito.addon.messaging.outgoing.defaultName=<default channel name>
----

The following properties are mandatory for each channel:

* `connector`: This property needs to be set to `smallrye-kafka`.
* Depending on whether the channel is incoming or outgoing:
** `value.deserializer`: This property is used for incoming channels. Unless you have specific marshaling requirements, you must set this property to `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArrayDeserializer` or `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer`.
** `value.serializer`: This property is used for outgoing channels. Unless you have specific marshaling requirements, you must set this property to `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArraySerializer` or `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`.

[TIP]
====
`topic` is another relevant but optional property that might be set for a channel. The `topic` property contains the Apache Kafka topic name to be used for a channel. If `topic` property is not set, then the channel name is used as topic name. 
====

For more information about the properties that you can use for a channel when using Apache Kafka connector, see the link:{kafka_connector_properties_url}[properties] list.

=== Examples of Smallrye channel mapping

This section describes examples of channel mapping, using the properties mentioned in the previous section.

One Smallrye channel per CloudEvent type::
+
--
The link:{callback_example_url}[`serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus`] example application uses two CloudEvent types, including `wait` (incoming) and `resume` (outgoing).

Kafka topic names match the CloudEvent types. Therefore, it is suitable to select the mapping strategy of one channel per CloudEvent type. This suggests that two channels must be configured. Note that you do not need to set the optional `topic` property as the channel name matches the CloudEvent type.

.Example property configuration
[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.wait.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.wait.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer

mp.messaging.outgoing.resume.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.resume.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
----
--

Default channel mapping::
+
--
The link:{events_example_url}[`serverless-workflow-events-quarkus`] example application uses two CloudEvent types, including `applicants` (incoming) and `decisions` (outgoing).

As mentioned before, Kafka topic names match the CloudEvent types. However, to use the default channel functionality, `kogito_incoming_stream` and `kogito_outgoing_stream` are used as channel names. As explained before, since there is no specific channel name for the CloudEvent type, then the default channels are used. Also, the default channels need to be mapped to the desired topic name using the `topic` property.

.Example property configuration
[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.topic=applicants
mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer

mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.topic=decisions
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
----
--

== OnOverflow handling

Smallrye provide means to link:{overflow_management_url}[manage emitter overflow] through link:{overflow_annotation_url}[OnOverflow] annotation

Kogito will annotate generated smallrye `emitters` for a particular channel using the information provided by a property of the form `kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.<channel_name>.overflow-strategy`. The possible values are `BUFFER`, `NONE`, `UNBOUNDED`, `FAIL`, and `DROP`. If the value of the strategy is `BUFFER`, then you must specify the buffer size by using the property of the form `kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.<channel_name>.buffer-size` 

Therefore, for the `wait` channel, in the previous example, if we want to buffer as many as 100 events we will add these two properties

.Example overflow configuration
[source,properties]
----
kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.wait.overflow-strategy=BUFFER
kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.wait.buffer-size=100
----

If all your channels use the same strategy and this strategy differs from the `BUFFER` one (you can change buffer size globally by using the `mp.messaging.emitter.default-buffer-size` smallrye property). You can set it up by using `kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.overflow-strategy=NONE|UNBOUNDED|FAIL|DROP`
