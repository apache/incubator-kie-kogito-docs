:description: Timeouts showcase in Serverless Workflow
:keywords: kogito, workflow, serverless, timer, timeout

The timeouts showcase is designed to show how to configure and execute workflows that use timeouts, according to different deployment scenarios.
While all the scenarios contain the same set of workflows, they are provided as independent example projects, to facilitate the execution and understanding of each case.

The following workflows are provided:

* <<workflow_timeouts_workflow, `workflow_timeouts`>>
* <<callback_state_timeouts_workflow, `callback_state_timeouts`>>
* <<switch_state_timeouts_workflow, `switch_state_timeouts`>>
* <<event_state_timeouts_workflow, `event_state_timeouts`>>

[#workflow_timeouts_workflow]
== `workflow_timeouts` workflow

It is a simple workflow that, rather than configuring a timeout for a particular state, is configured for the whole execution of the workflow.
This can be done by using the `workflowExecTimeout` property, which defines the maximum workflow execution time. If this time is surpassed and the workflow has not finished, it will be automatically canceled.

See the xref:core/timeouts-support.adoc#workflow-timeout[workflow timeout definition] for more information.

[#callback_state_timeouts_workflow]
== `callback_state_timeouts` workflow

It is a simple workflow that, when the execution reaches the state `CallbackState`, an action is executed, and it waits for the event `callbackEvent` to arrive in order to continue the execution.
However, a timeout is configured to set the maximum waiting time for that event.

     "errorRef": "callbackError",
     "transition": "FinalizeWithError"
   }
 ],
 "timeouts": {
   "eventTimeout": "PT30S"
 }
}
----

The timeout is configured with a duration of 30 seconds, and if no event arrives during this time, the flow execution moves to the next state, and the workflow's data remains unchanged.

On the other hand, if the event arrive, the event payload is merged into the workflow's data, and thus, the `eventData` property of the workflow's data, will contain the information carried by the event payload.
Using this simple configuration strategy, the workflow can collect the event information, and use it for example to determine the path to go in the next state.

See the xref:core/timeouts-support.adoc#callback-state-timeout[callback state definition] for more information.

For more information about how the incoming event information can be merged into the workflow's data you can see link:{spec_doc_url}#Event-data-filters[Event data filters].

[#switch_state_timeouts_workflow]
== `switch_state_timeouts` workflow

This workflow is similar to the `callback_state_timeouts`, but when the execution reaches the state `ChooseOneEvent`, it waits for one of the two configured events, `visaDeniedEvent` or `visaApprovedEvent` to arrive.

If any of the configured events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow execution moves to the next state defined in the corresponding `transition`.

If none of the events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow execution moves to the state defined in the `defaultCondition` transition.

See the xref:core/timeouts-support.adoc#switch-state-timeout[switch state definition] for more information.

    }

[#event_state_timeouts_workflow]
== `event_state_timeouts` workflow

This workflow is similar to the `switch_state_timeouts`, but when the execution reaches the state `WaitForEvent`, it waits for one of the configured events, `event1` or `event2`, to arrive.
Each event has a number of configured actions to execute, but unlike the switch state, only one possible `transition` exists.

If none of the configured events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow execution moves to the next state defined in the `transition` property, skipping the events that were not received in time together with actions configured for them.

If one of the events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow executes the corresponding actions, and finally moves to the state defined in `transition`.

[NOTE]
====
The semantic of this state might vary depending on the `exclusive` flag, in the example the default value of `true` will be applied, and thus, the workflow will transition as soon as the first event arrives.

== Executing the workflows

To execute the workflows you can use any of the available deployment scenarios:

* <<execute-operator-dev-profile, {product_name} Operator Dev Profile>>

* <<execute-quarkus-project-embedded-services, Quarkus Workflow Project with embedded services>>

* <<execute-quarkus-project-standalone-services, Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services>>

[#execute-operator-dev-profile]
=== {product_name} Operator Dev Profile

When you work with the xref:cloud/operator/developing-workflows.adoc[{operator_name} Dev Profile], the operator will automatically provision an execution environment that contains an embedded {job_service_xref}[job service] instance, as well as an instance of the {data_index_xref}[data index service].
And thus, there is no need for additional configurations when you use timeouts.

To execute the workflows you must:

In a command terminal, clone the `kogito-examples` repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/main/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-operator-devprofile/README.md[these steps]:

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples.git

cd kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-operator-devprofile
----

[#execute-quarkus-project-embedded-services]
=== Quarkus Workflow Project with embedded services

Similar to the <<#execute-operator-dev-profile, {operator_name} Dev Profile>>, this scenario shows how to configure the embedded {job_service_xref}[job service] and {data_index_xref}[data index service], when you work with a Quarkus Workflow project and it is also intended for development purposes.

In a command terminal, clone the `kogito-examples` repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-embedded/README.md[these steps]:

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples.git

cd kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-embedded
----


[#execute-quarkus-project-standalone-services]
=== Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services

This is the most complex and close to a production scenario. In this case, the workflows, the {job_service_xref}[job service], the {data_index_xref}[data index service], and the database are deployed as standalone services in the kubernetes or knative cluster.
Additionally, the communications from the workflows to the {job_service_xref}[job service], and from the {job_service_xref}[job service] to the {data_index_xref}[data index service], are resolved via the knative eventing system.

[NOTE]
====
By using the knative eventing system the underlying low level communication system is transparent to the integration.
====


==== Architecture

The following diagram shows the architecture for this use case:

. Every time a workflow needs to program a timer for a given timeout, a cloud event is sent to the {job_service_xref}#integration-with-the-workflows[job service] for that purpose.
. When a timer is overdue, a rest call is executed to notify the workflow, which then must execute accordingly to the given state semantic.
. Workflow and job status changes are propagated to the {data_index_xref}[data index service] via cloud events.

.Knative Workflow with Job Service architecture
image::use-cases/timeouts-showcase/timeouts-showcase-extended-architecture.png[]

* *timeouts-showcase-extended:* Is the Quarkus Workflow Project that contains the workflows, that must be maven build, and deployed into the kubernetes cluster.

* *jobs-service-postresql:* Is the job service that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster.

* *data-index-service-postgresql:* Is the data index service that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster.

* *timeouts-showcase-database:* Is the PostgreSQL instance that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For simplification purposes, a single database instance is used for both services to store the information about the workflow instances, and the timers.  However, in a production environment is recommended to have independent database instances.
====

==== Running the example

To execute the workflows you must:

In a command terminal, clone the `kogito-examples` repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-extended/README.md[these steps]:

[source, bash]
----
