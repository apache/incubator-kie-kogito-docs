== Brief introduction to Saga pattern

Saga is a design pattern to manage data consistency across participants in distributed transaction scenarios, the initial link:https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf[publication] is a good reference.

In a microservice architecture, a participant could be defined as a microservice, responsible to perform actions related to its business domain.
Saga is meant to provide transaction management using a sequence of steps.

While executing a step, failures might happen. In this situation, a sequence of compensating actions is executed to undo the changes made during the execution or leave the system in a known termination state, aiming for consistency.

== The order fulfillment example

This is a very common use case, present in many e-commerce companies and for sure it should be familiar to you.

The basic idea in this scenario is a user buys some item through an e-commerce application inputting the payment method and delivery information, and waits for this item to be delivered at the specified address.

Given this use case, what happens behind the scenes is a sequence of steps that should be executed to complete the order, as shown in the picture:

.Example Order fulfillment
image::use-cases/orchestration-based-saga-pattern/order-fulfillment-example.png[]

In the example, there are the mainly following steps:

<1> _Order checkout_: the user confirms the order with the chosen items, payment method, and delivery address.
<2> _Stock reservation_: where this item from the order is selected from the stock and reserved, being removed from the total stock item.
<3> _Payment processing_: based on the payment method and the user information, for instance, the credit card, the credit is checked and allocated to that payment.
<4> _Shipping processing_: it represents a mechanism that could communicate with third-party systems responsible to deliver orders or even an internal system responsible for logistics and delivery.

The below picture makes it possible to visualize the two main flows in case of success or failure during the order fulfillment flow, which describes a Saga pattern.

.Example Order fulfillment Saga
image::use-cases/orchestration-based-saga-pattern/order-fulfillment-saga.png[]

In the first case, the happy path, the item stock is reserved. After that, the payment is successfully processed, the order shipping is scheduled, and the flow is completed for that order.

The second case describes an example of a failure or any error thrown during the shipping process for a given order. In this situation, a sequence of compensation actions is executed, which cancels the payment, and releases the stock for the items related to that order.

== Saga orchestration with Serverless workflow

As a developer, you can use link:{spec_doc_url}[Serverless Workflow] to create a workflow that impletemens the Saga pattern where you can define all the steps and compensations.

In this scenario, Kogito Serverless Workflow plays the Saga Executor Coordinator (SEC) role, which orchestrates the calls to the participants in the Saga.

The order fulfillment example showcases how to define the Saga with Kogito Serverless Workflow. The source code can be found here in link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus[serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus].

The workflow definition used to define the order saga is link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus/src/main/resources/order-saga-error-handling.sw.json[order-saga-error-handling.sw.json].

.Example Order fulfillment Saga Workflow

In the workflow diagram, you can see the calls to the participants, the possible errors each service can throw, and how to define compensations for each step to be executed once an error happens during workflow execution.

=== Saga participants interactions

To define the interactions among participants in the Saga using Serverless Workflow Specification, you can use link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-states[states] with link:{spec_doc_url}#Transitions[transitions] corresponding to the participant's interactions.

Each state represents a step to be achieved in the Saga, and an action associated with the state represents how to invoke a participant to execute a given step. So, for instance, the `processPayment` state has the `processPaymentAction` action responsible for invoking the function to execute the payment processing, which the participant `Payment Service` might do.

The `transition` attribute represents the next step to be started, to perform the order shipping scheduling for the Saga.

[#payment-state]
.Example the state declaration representing the process payment step in the Saga
[source,json]
----
{
   "name":"processPayment",
   "type":"operation",
   "actions":[
      {
         "name":"processPaymentAction",
         "functionRef":{
            "refName":"processPayment",
            "arguments":{
               "orderId":".orderId",
               "failService":".failService"
            }
         },
         "actionDataFilter":{
            "results":".",
            "toStateData":".paymentResponse"
         }
      }
   ],
   "transition":"scheduleShipping",
   "compensatedBy":"CancelPayment",
   "onErrors":[
      {
         "errorRef":"process payment failed",
         "transition":"ServiceError"
      }
   ]
}
----

=== Compensations

The core functionality when designing the Saga is the compensation for each step to be executed by a participant.

In Serverless Workflow, each state should define how it should be compensated using its `compensatedBy` attribute, which indicates another state responsible to perform the compensation for it, i.e. `processPayment` defines the `CancelPayment` as the compensation on the  <<payment-state, payment state>>.

[source,json]
"compensatedBy": "CancelPayment"

=== Errors

Once an error occurs during the workflow execution, a compensation flow is then triggered.

Errors are identified by a name and can be associated with a state, for instance, for the `processPayment` state, there is the `process payment failed` error, which is a reference to the <<#errors-definitions, errors section>> in the workflow definition.

[#errors-definitions]
.Example the error declaration for the Saga
[source,json]
----
{
   "errors":[
      {
         "name":"reserve stock failed",
         "code":"org.kie.kogito.ServiceException"
      },
      {
         "name":"process payment failed",
         "code":"org.kie.kogito.ServiceException"
      },
      {
         "name":"shipping failed",
         "code":"org.kie.kogito.ServiceException"
      }
   ]
}
----

An error definition uses the FQCN of Java exceptions thrown by functions, in the given example, `org.kie.kogito.ServiceException` is thrown by they service calls defined as a  <<#custom-function, Java method>> here is the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/PaymentService.java[source], however, they could be any type of link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-functions[functions], i.e REST, OpenAPI, gRPC, etc.

For more details about error handling see xref:core/understanding-workflow-error-handling.adoc[Understanding workflow error handling].

[#custom-function]

{
   "name":"reserveStock",
   "type":"custom",
   "operation":"service:org.kie.kogito.PaymentService::processPayment"
}
----

The Kogito workflow engine controls the execution flow keeping track of the steps that need compensation. The engine also ensures that the compensation states are executed in reverse order of each completed step.

The engine is a stateful, which allows Saga to be long-lived containing wait states, such as callbacks. After each wait state, the workflow is persisted and can continue once it receives another request or event.

For simplicity, the current example shows a Saga workflow executed as a request-response. This is also called straight-through workflow, meaning that an entire workflow is executed from start to end in a single request.

=== Running and testing the example

==== Creating a new Success Order
:order_saga_workflow_path: order_saga_error_workflow
//POST /{order_saga_workflow_path}

.Example success request
[source,shell]
----
curl -L -X POST "http://localhost:8080/order_saga_error_workflow" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
 "workflowdata": {
  "orderId": "03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa"
 }
}'
----

.Example success response
[source,json]
----
{
   "id":"b5c0bf16-1e37-4d7a-82cd-610809090d9c",
   "workflowdata":{
      "orderId":"03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa",
      "stockResponse":{
         "type":"SUCCESS",
         "resourceId":"dc32abe6-9706-4061-8e96-910d8e06728d"
      },
      "paymentResponse":{
         "type":"SUCCESS",
         "resourceId":"505259d9-1c12-40ea-af5d-679e2cd89394"
      },
      "shippingResponse":{
         "type":"SUCCESS",
         "resourceId":"d6e2d538-0229-4b8e-a363-17ebabdb3585"
      },
      "orderResponse":{
         "type":"SUCCESS",
         "resourceId":"03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa"
      }
   }
}
----

The response contains the workflow data with nested attributes representing the responses related to the execution of each step, either success or failure.
The `orderResponse` attribute indicates if the order can be confirmed by the client starting the Saga workflow, in case the value is `success` the order can be confirmed otherwise it can be canceled.

In the console executing the application, you can check the log with information related to the executed steps.

==== Simulating errors to activate the compensations

To make testing the workflow easier it was introduced an optional attribute `failService` that indicates which service should respond with an error. The attribute is the simple class name of the service to return an error. In the following request example, the `ShippingService` should throw an error that breaks the workflow execution triggering the compensations.

.Example compensation request
[source,shell]

curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/order_saga_error_workflow' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
 "workflowdata": {
  "orderId": "03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa",
  "failService": "ShippingService"
 }
}'
