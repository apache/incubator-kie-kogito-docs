= Example of {product_name} application using OpenAPI callback events with Quarkus

To understand the OpenAPI Callback, see the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus`] example application in GitHub repository.

This example contains a simple link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-workflow[workflow-service] that illustrates callback state using OpenAPI callbacks functionality. A callback is a state that invokes an action and wait for an event (event that will be eventually fired by the external service notified by the action). This example consists of a callback state that waits for an event to arrive at the wait channel. Its action calls an external service named link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-event-service[callback-event-service] that publishes the wait event over HTTP. After consuming the wait event, the workflow prints the message received in the wait event and ends the workflow.

The `serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus` application is initiated with the following request to `http://localhost:8080/callback`:
[code,json]
----
{
  "message": "Hello"
}
----
Once the workflow is started, it makes an external service call with the callback URL and the workflow instance ID in the request body to link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-event-service[callback-event-service]. Then, as configured in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-workflow/src/main/resources/specs/callback.yaml[OpenAPI] file, the callback URL is invoked to send a CloudEvent to the workflow.

Once the `wait` type CloudEvent is received by the callback-workflow-service, the workflow moves to the next state and ends successfully. The following figure shows the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus`] image:

To use the OpenAPI callback in a workflow, the OpenAPI YAML file is configured with the callback as specified in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-workflow/src/main/resources/specs/callback.yaml[OpenAPI] file.

To use the Callback state in a workflow, first CloudEvent type `wait` is declared that the workflow uses. Following is an example of CloudEvents declaration in a workflow definition:

.Example of CloudEvent declaration in a workflow definition
[code,json]
----
 "events": [
    {
      "name": "waitEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "wait"
    }
----

After that, a Callback state is declared, which waits for a CloudEvent with the `wait` type. Following is an example of declaring a Callback state that handles the `wait` type CloudEvent:

[code,json]
----
 {
      "name": "waitForEvent",
      "type": "callback",
      "action":
        {
        "functionRef": {
          "refName": "callBack",
          "arguments": {
            "uri": "http://localhost:8080/wait",
            "processInstanceId": "$WORKFLOW.instanceId"
          }
        }
      },
      "eventRef": "waitEvent",
      "transition": "finish"
    }

An link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-event-service/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/examples/CallbackResource.java[event listener] publishes a new `wait` type CloudEvent. Following is an example of a Java method that publishes the `wait` type CloudEvent:

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public void wait(EventInput eventInput) throws JsonProcessingException {
        logger.info("About to generate event for {}",eventInput);
        CloudEventBuilder builder = CloudEventBuilder.v1()
                .withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .withSource(URI.create(""))
                .withType("wait")
                .withTime(OffsetDateTime.now())
                .withExtension(CloudEventExtensionConstants.PROCESS_REFERENCE_ID, eventInput.getProcessInstanceId())
                .withData(objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(Collections.singletonMap("message", "New Event")));

        webClient.postAbs(eventInput.getUri()).sendJson(builder.build()).toCompletionStage();
    }

The callback-workflow-service consumes the CloudEvent, it contains an attribute named `kogitoprocrefid`, which holds the instance ID of the workflow.

The `kogitoprocrefid` attribute is crucial because when the correlation is not used, then this attribute is the only way for the Callback state to identify that the related CloudEvent needs to be used to resume the workflow. For more information about correlation, see xref:eventing/event-correlation-with-workflows.adoc[Event correlation in {product_name}].

Note that each workflow is identified by a unique instance ID, which is automatically included in any published CloudEvent, as `kogitoprocinstanceid` CloudEvent extension.

== HTTP transport configuration
The `serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus` example application consumes the Cloudevents using Knative Eventing. For more information about incoming and outgoing CloudEvents oer HTTP, see xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/event-orchestration/consume-produce-events-with-knative-eventing.adoc[Consuming and Producing CloudEvents over HTTP].

The HTTP path where the workflow application will listen for the CloudEvents in the `serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus` example application, is configured in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus/callback-workflow/src/main/resources/application.properties[`application.properties`] file as shown below:
