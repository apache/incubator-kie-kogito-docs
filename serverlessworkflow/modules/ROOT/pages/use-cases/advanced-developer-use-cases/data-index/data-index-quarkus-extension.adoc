This document describes how you add the {data_index_ref} features to your workflow. You simply need to add the {data_index_ref} extension to the workflow and
the related data will be collected and stored in the database, enabling the GraphQL endpoint to execute queries and perform management operations over the {workflow_instances}.
The example described in this document is based on the link:{kogito_sw_timeouts_showcase_embedded_example_url}[`serverless-workflow-timeouts_showcase_embedded`] example application.

[[data-index-ext-overview]]
== Overview

The {data_index_ref} service has been designed to store and manage data from different workflow instances.
Communication with the service is through events that contain the workflows related data and the service is responsible for storing them and exposing a GraphQL endpoint to allow queries and maintenance operations on the different workflow instances.

In specific use cases, to avoid deploying the service separately, it could be useful to have the indexing functionality and the query capabilities embedded in the same application.
For this purpose, the Quarkus {data_index_ref} extension can be added to any workflow application and incorporates the full {data_index_ref} functionality into the same application without needing an external {data_index_ref} service.
These extensions are distributed as addons ready to work with different types of persistence:

* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-inmemory (inmemory PostgreSQL)
* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql
* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-infinispan
* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-mongodb

With the same purpose, the Quarkus {data_index_ref} persistence extension can be added to any workflow application and incorporates only the {data_index_ref} indexation and data persistence functionality into the same application without needing an external {data_index_ref} service to do that.
These extensions are distributed as addons ready to work with different types of persistence:

* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence-postgresql
* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence-infinispan
* kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence-mongodb

In this case to interact with that data and related runtimes using GraphQL you will need an external {data_index_ref} service that makes that endpoint available.

[NOTE]
====
The {data_index_ref} extensions are provided as addons for each kind of supported persistence relying on the link:{quarkus_guides_base_url}/writing-extensions[Quarkus extensions] mechanism.
====

Once one of these `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index` or `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence` addons is added to a workflow, it incorporates the functionality to index and store the workflow data. In case of the `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index` also incorporates the GraphQL endpoint to perform queries and management operations.

In the same way as the {data_index_ref} service, there is a specific addon for each type of persistence you want to work with. Currently, you can find {data_index_ref} addons for: link:{postgresql_url}[PostgreSQL], link:{infinispan_url}[Infinispan], and link:{mongo_url}[MongoDB]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {data_index_ref} addon distribution added to the workflow must match the workflow's persistence type regarding the indexed data, which can be stored in the same database.
The addon will share the data source used by the workflow where it is added, and it will create separate tables for that purpose.
====

When any of the `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index`  or `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence` addons is added:

* The communication with the workflow is direct, the workflow data is *not* transmitted or consumed through events, they are stored directly in the configured database.
There is no need to configure the events connection for this purpose.

Only when any of the `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index` addons is added:

* A new GraphQL endpoint is added to perform queries and management operations when `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index` is added

== Adding {data_index_ref} extension to a workflow application

You can add the {data_index_ref} quarkus extension as an addon:

.Prerequisites
* Your workflow is running and has persistence enabled.
* {data_index_ref} is using the same datasource to store indexed data
+
For more information about creating a workflow, see {getting_started_create_first_workflow_guide}[Creating your first workflow]. You also can find more details about enabling persistence in {persistence_with_postgresql_guide}[Running a workflow using PostgreSQL]

.Procedure
. Add the `kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index` extension to your Quarkus Workflow Project using any of the following alternatives:
+
--

[tabs]
====
Manually to the POM.xml::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
    <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
Apache Maven::
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql"
----
Quarkus CLI::
+
[source,shell]
----
quarkus extension add kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql
----
====

--

. Configure the Data Index Addon properties.
+
--
Prepare the workflow to run in dev mode, avoid starting the {data_index_ref} Quarkus Dev service, and specify if the GraphQL UI needs to be available.

.Example adding Data Index addon properties in `application.properties` file
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kogito.devservices.enabled=false <1>
quarkus.kogito.data-index.graphql.ui.always-include=true <2>
----
<1> By default, when a workflow is running in dev mode, automatically a Data Index Dev Service is started and a temporary dev service Database is created.
When adding the addon to the workflow, you need to disable it by setting `quarkus.kogito.devservices.enabled` to `false` in the `application.properties` file.
<2> The addon allows to expose a simple UI to interact with the GraphQL endpoint, it only will be available when this property is set to `true`, and it will be placed in '<applicationURL>/graphql-ui/`

For more information, see `application.properties` file of link:{kogito_sw_timeouts_showcase_embedded_example_application_properties_url}[`serverless-timeouts_showcase_embedded`] example application.
