This document describes how to build a images of {product_name} example applications using the link:{quarkus_cli_url}[Quarkus CLI].

.Prerequisites
include::./../../../../pages/_common-content/getting-started-requirement.adoc[]
* Latest version of Docker is installed. Alternatively, you can use link:{google_jib_url}[Jib] to build container images. However, Docker is required to build GraalVM native image using the Quarkus native builder image.
* Optionally, GraalVM {graalvm_min_version} is installed.
* Install the Quarkus command line interface (CLI). For more information, see link:{quarkus_cli_url}[Installing the Quarkus CLI].

== Using an example application

To get started with building workflow images, you can use the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`] example application.
However, same procedure can be applied to any example located in link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}[{product_name} example repository]

NOTE: You can skip the following procedure if you already have a workflow application.

.Procedure
. Clone the link:{kogito_sw_examples_git_repo_url}[kogito-examples] repository and navigate to the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`] example application.
+
.Clone an example application
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone --branch main {kogito_sw_examples_git_repo_url} 
cd kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus
----

. To run the example application, follow the instructions located in the README.md of the examples. Every example application provides a file with instructions on how to run and work with it.
. Play with the example and explore {product_name} capabilities.
