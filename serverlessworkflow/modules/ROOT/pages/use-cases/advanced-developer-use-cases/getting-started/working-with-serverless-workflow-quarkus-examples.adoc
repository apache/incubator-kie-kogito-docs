== Using an example application

To get started with our examples, you can use the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`] example application.
However, same procedure can be applied to any example located in link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}[{product_name} example repository].

.Procedure
. Clone the link:{kogito_sw_examples_git_repo_url}[kogito-examples] repository and navigate to the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus`] example application.

.Clone an example application
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone --branch main {kogito_sw_examples_git_repo_url} 
cd incubator-kie-kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus
