= Environment setup

This guide lists the different ways to set up your environment for {product_name} development. 
If you are new, start with the minimal one.

[[proc-minimal-local-environment-setup]]
== Minimal local environment setup

Recommended steps to setup your local development environment. By completing these steps you are able to
start the development on your local machine using our guides.

.Procedure
. Install https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] or https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman].
. Install https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[minikube] or https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation[kind].
. Install https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubernetes CLI].
. Install https://knative.dev/docs/install/quickstart-install/[Knative using quickstart]. This will also setup Knative Serving and Eventing for you and the cluster should be running.
. xref:cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.adoc[]
. Install xref:testing-and-troubleshooting/kn-plugin-workflow-overview.adoc[Knative Workflow CLI].
. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kie-group.swf-vscode-extension[our extension] that simplifies development of workflows by provifing visual aids and auto-complete features.

[[proc-starting-cluster-fo-local-development]]
== Starting the cluster for local development

If you have used https://knative.dev/docs/install/quickstart-install/[Knative using quickstart] guide, your selected cluster should be running and properly configured to work with our guides.

Please note, that if the knative quickstart procedure is not used, you need to install Knative Serving and Eventing manually. See <<proc-additional-options-for-local-environment>>.


.To startup the selected cluster without quickstart, use the following command:
[tabs]
====
Minikube::
+
--
.Configure and startup minikube
[source,shell]
----
# Set a driver and container runtime
minikube config set driver docker/podman
minikube config set container-runtime docker/podman

# Set cpu and memory
# 4096 is minimal baseline, increase to 6144 or 8192 if possible
minikube config set cpus 4
minikube config set memory 4096

# Start the cluster
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons registry --addons metrics-server --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24" --insecure-registry "localhost:5000"

# Set the active profile
minikube profile minikube

[[proc-advanced-local-environment-setup]]
== Advanced local environment setup

If you are interested in our Java and Quarkus development path, consider completing this procedure in addition to the
<<proc-minimal-local-environment-setup>>. By completing these steps you are able to start the development of applications on your local machine using our xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/index.adoc[advanced developer guides].

.Procedure
. Install https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK] {java_min_version} and cofigure `JAVA_HOME` appropriately by adding it to the `PATH`.
. Install https://maven.apache.org/index.html[Apache Maven] {maven_min_version}.
. Install https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling[Quarkus CLI] corresponding to currently supported version by {product_name}. Currently it is {quarkus_version}.

[[proc-additional-options-for-local-environment]]
== Additional options for local environment setup

Points listed in this section provide extra posibilties when working with our guides and are considered optional.

* Install https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] {graalvm_min_version}. This will allow you to create https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/[native image] of your {product_name} application.
* Install https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/[Knative Serving using YAML files] for advanced customizations or in cases where the quickstart procedure fails.
* Install https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/eventing/install-eventing-with-yaml/[Knative Eventing using YAML files] for advanced customizations or in cases where the quickstart procedure fails.
