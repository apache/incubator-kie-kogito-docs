= Creating your first workflow service

As a developer, you can use {product_name} and create a `Hello World` application, which includes the following procedures:

* <<proc-boostrapping-a-project,Bootstrapping a project>>
* <<proc-creating-a-workflow,Creating a workflow>>
* <<proc-building-your-workflow-application,Building your workflow application>>
* <<proc-running-your-workflow-application,Running your workflow application>>
* <<proc-testing-your-workflow-application,Testing your workflow application>>

Also, you can directly access an example application by cloning `serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-hello-world` from the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-hello-world[GitHub repository].

This document describes how to create a workflow application that serves a `hello_world` endpoint. The workflow contains the following two states:

* `Inject Hello World`: Injects a `Hello World` message into the response
* `Inject Mantra`: Injects a `Mantra` message into the response
