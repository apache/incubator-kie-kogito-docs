= Creating your first workflow service

As a developer, you can use {context} and create a `Hello World` application, which includes the following procedures:

* xref:getting-started/modules/proc-boostrapping-the-project.adoc[Bootstrapping a project]
* xref:getting-started/modules/proc-creating-workflow.adoc[Creating a workflow]
* xref:getting-started/modules/proc-running-application.adoc[Running your workflow application]
* xref:getting-started/modules/proc-testing-application.adoc[Testing your workflow application]

Also, you can directly access an example application by cloning `serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-hello-world` from the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-hello-world[GitHub repository].

This document describes how to create a workflow application that serves a `hello_world` endpoint. The workflow contains the following two states:

* `Inject Hello World`: Injects a `Hello World` message into the response
* `Inject Mantra`: Injects a `Mantra` message into the response

.Example Hello World workflow
