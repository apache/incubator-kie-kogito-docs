# Script to copy over the latest "numbered" version to the build directory
# Must be called AFTER the website being built by "npm run install-build"
# It will create a new directory with the numbered version, e.g. 1.32.0.Final with the contents of the "latest" directory.
# We do this way because the GH Pages can't have redirection/rewrite rules applied like suggested on Antora pages: https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/urls-redirect-facility/
# See JIRA: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-8408
